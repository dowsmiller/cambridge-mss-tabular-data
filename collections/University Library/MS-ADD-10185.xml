                            <seg type="para">Attributed to the Augustinian Priory of Holy Trinity, Ipswich, and dated to around the second half of the
                                thirteenth century, this roll provides a record of the priory's rental income from property it owned in the town of
                                Ipswich and parishes or manors in the surrounding countryside.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">It may have been created as a routine part of the priory's record-keeping. However, much care was taken
                                over its creation: notably, the use of a formal, littera textualis script, unusual in a document of this nature. There
                                is a notable lack of evidence of further use: a few annotations in plummet - mostly sums of money, perhaps adjustments
                                to rents - against entries in Helmingham, with a few erasures and supplementary entries in pen scattered throughout
                                the document. This suggests that the roll was created with a specific purpose in mind that, once answered, no longer
                                required the document to be repeatedly amended or consulted. Several papal edicts were issued in the second half of
                                the thirteenth century, granting the English Crown a tenth of ecclesiastical revenues for a set number of years, for
                                the purpose of going on crusade to the Holy Land. These were usually accompanied by instructions for a fresh valuation
                                of the incomes of churches and religious houses. One such edict, perhaps the grant of Gregory X at the Council of
                                Lyons in 1274 (from which the Augustinians were not exempted), may have prompted Holy Trinity to gather information
                                about the rents it received from its temporal land holdings, and thus resulted in the creation of the present roll.
                                Further prosopographical study might be a fruitful line of enquiry for more precise dating of the roll: specifically,
                                the comparison of names listed with those in other documents of this period such as the 1282 Lay Subsidy, another
                                rental compiled perhaps early in the reign of Edward I (now <bibl>Ipswich, Suffolk Record Office, HD1/9/1/4/1</bibl>). </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The roll comprises seven and a half parchment membranes; the first, blank membrane formed a protective
                                outer wrapper. On the remaining membranes are written the names of tenants occupying property, first in Ipswich and
                                then in the surrounding countryside, belonging to the priory of Holy Trinity. In four columns to the right, the roll
                                details the rents due to the Priory at one or more of the quarter days, which coincided with four feasts throughout
                                the religious calendar: Michaelmas (29th September), St Andrew (30th November), Easter (moveable) and John the Baptist
                                (24th June). The rents are mostly recorded in pence ('d'), halfpence ('ob') or farthings ('q<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>'). Within Ipswich, there are listed the parishes of St Margaret, St Mary-le-Tower, St Mary-at-the-Elms, St
                                Clement, St Lawrence and St Mary-at-the-Quay. Countryside villages begin on the fifth membrane, and include (among
                                others): Claydon, Westerfield, Rushmere, Tuddenham and Culpho to the north; Clopton, Monewden, Grundisburgh and
                                Helmingham further to the north; Kirton in Colness, Shotley, Erwarton, Chelmondiston and Stutton to the east and
                                south; and Sproughton, Chattisham, Bramford and Nettlestead to the west. Among the locations listed are settlements
                                that have been absorbed into the suburbs of Ipswich (such as Thurleston, Bixley and Cauldwell) and others that were
                                abandoned later in the medieval period (such as Nekemere, remains of which were discovered near Playford in the
                                1970s).</seg>
                            <seg type="para">In total, the roll contains some 340 or so entries, plus a handful of contemporary or near-contemporary
                                additions by various hands. Most of these entries are the names of individuals. Some indicate that tenancies passed
                                down through families: within Rushmere, there is listed 'Thomas le Iur et heredes sui' and 'Heredes Heruei sperling'.
                                Shared tenancies occured too: multiple names are given (as with 'Simon Brid . Mattheus Brid' or 'Iohannes et Rogerus
                                Ketel' in Cauldwell), or simply unnamed partners (as with 'Ricardus Ioie de Nekemere et particeps eius'). Some
                                individuals held multiple tenancies and are listed more than once. William Sprot is named three times within
                                Cauldwell: his name is the first in the list, then recurs twice further down, the third entry being merely 'Idem W'
                                ('the same W[illiam]'). Notes to the right of the second and third entries distinguished the payments from one another
                                by specifying the lands concerned. In some cases, similar details are added elsewhere: for example, John de Livretot
                                was paying for the lands of Peter of Bramford, with woods, and was making a separate payment of twenty-five or
                                twenty-six pence four times a year for the mill of Shirbelund (i.e. a water mill on the River Gipping, near to where
                                Shrubland Hall now stands).</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Besides its purely functional purpose as a record of the priory's rental income, the roll provides
                                valuable insights into the texture of the economic life of the area and the origins, professions and status of a
                                substantial number of its inhabitants. Many of the tenants' surnames indicate the trades or crafts that they
                                practised; these are most heavily concentrated within the town of Ipswich. In the parish of St Margaret, one finds
                                'Willelmus Carpentarius' (= carpenter), 'Adam tinctor' (= dyer), 'Rogerus cocus' (= cook), 'Willelmus plumbarius' (=
                                lead-worker), 'Elias le Cupere' (= cooper / barrel-maker), 'Stephanus piscator' (= fisherman). In the parish of St
                                Mary-le-Tower, there is listed 'Rogerus cellarius' (= cellar-keeper), 'laurencius ypotecarius' (= apothecary) and
                                'Willelmus seruus Decani' (= the Dean's servant). 'Laurencius Molendarius' (= miller) and 'Philippus le luminur' (=
                                gilder or illuminator) are recorded in the parish of St Mary-at-the-Elms, while 'Willelmus Cyrotecarius' (= glover)
                                and 'vxor Roberti Citharedis' (= wife of Robert the lyre-player). Female names feature frequently as independent
                                tenants: 'Alicia Smewine et Matilda soror eius' (= her sister), 'Matilda Cheling', 'Iuliana Horold', 'Emma Bonhomme',
                                and 'Cristina Spendelue', among others. Some women were apparently possessed of sufficient social presence that their
                                status as 'mistress' was recorded: 'Domina oliua de frenei' in Rushmere, and 'Domina Matilda Virdun' in Tuddenham and
                                Culpho. Others were clearly craftswomen in their own right: 'Claricia Caretaria' (= carter or cartwright) in the
                                parish of St Mary-le-Tower, or 'Moriella textrix' (= weaver) in the village of Helmingham. Some unusual names are also
                                worthy of note: 'Claudianus de Langh', 'Robertus Gnatte', 'Gilbertus Haredscho', 'Gilbertus le Gamemgrom' and
                                'Constantinus Scheit'.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Toponymic surnames also indicate the places of origin of residents of Ipswich and its nearby villages.
                                Names that refer to other local settlements include: 'Agnes de Bromeswelle' (= Bromeswell), 'Mabilia de Belinges' (=
                                Bealings). Other individuals came from further afield within Suffolk: 'Iohannes de Wachesham' (= Wattisham), 'Simon de
                                Debenham', 'Robertus de Orford', and 'Rogerus de Berkingke' (= Barking). A few came from further away still: 'Iohannes
                                de Bochingh' (= Bocking, Essex), 'Willelmus de Crokestun' (= perhaps Croxton, Cambridgeshire, or Croxton, near
                                Thetford), and 'Radulphus de soham' (= perhaps Soham, Cambridgeshire, or Earl / Monk Soham, Suffolk), 'Marg[aret] de
                                londres' and 'Malina de lundres' (= London), and perhaps even Wales ('Iordanus le Waleis').</seg>

                                Trinity rental roll was purchased at auction by Cambridge University Library on 6 July 2017. Since W.P. Hunt's
                                transcription left many abbreviations unexpanded, and contains various errors of reading, a fresh transcription will

                                at the British Library has been digitised and is now <ref target="http://access.bl.uk/item/viewer/ark:/81055/vdc_0000000563E2">available online</ref>.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Since arriving at the University Library, the roll has been fully digitised. During this process, it was
                                observed that a hitherto unrecorded portion of text at the end of the penultimate membrane was obscured by the
                                stitching used to attach the final membrane. The text is impossible to photograph directly; the stitching, being
                                original to the document, would not be removed. In order to capture the text, the roll was placed on top of a light
                                box mounted with a studio flash light. Six images were taken with light shining through the parchment while mild
                                pressure was applied successively around each part of the text, in order to make the image as sharp as possible. The
                                roll was then turned over and the process repeated. The resulting images were then combined with a technique known as
                                'focus stacking', producing thereby a clear image of the text for both the recto and the verso. The final image of the
                                text as seen through the back of the document was then reversed so that the text would be easily readable. Thanks to
                                the skill of Amélie Deblauwe, Senior Digitisation Technician, this text has now been fully recovered: the results are
                                reproduced here as 'obscured(r)' and 'obscured(v)'. A video showing both stages in the digitisation process is
                                available here:</seg>

                            <seg type="para">On each of the preceding membranes, space was left at the end to accommodate the stitching required to
                                attach the next sheet of parchment. On the penultimate membrane, however, the compiler of the entries appears not to
                                have anticipated the addition of a further sheet, and wrote entries up to the very end. The final membrane may have
                                been an after-thought: it is a half-sheet, containing entries not for a parish but for the manor of Casenel, which was
                                situated to the east of Ipswich near present-day Foxhall and Brightwell (and therefore somewhat out of order in the
                                geographical sequence of entries on the rest of the roll). Perhaps some of the membranes remained physically separate
                                while entries were compiled, or were circulated independently thereafter before being stitched together. In any case,
                                the photography of the overlapping sheets confirms that the text, though hidden, was not in fact lost. The entry -
                                'Pro terra Hugonis Mowe in willa de Sproutune heredes Thome de Porta' - was re-written, apparently by the same hand,
                                in a gap between entries for the parishes of Stutton and Chattisham, just above the stitching. This suggests that the
                                addition of the final half-membrane, though unplanned, was likely to have been near-contemporary with the copying of
                                the roll.</seg>

                                <condition>Two small faults in the parchment in the third membrane. Occasional damp-staining or water damage, none
                                    affecting the text: a wide vertical band along the left-hand edge of the second membrane; patches on the third and
                                    fourth membranes; two thin horizontal bands of discolouration on the fifth membrane. The first membrane is heavily
                                    soiled in the upper part of the verso, and has frequent minor tears along both edges, consistent with its position
                                    as the outer wrapper. Occasional small tears elsewhere. Stitching appears to be original and is intact and stable.
                                    A hole with thread attached is present at the foot of the fourth membrane, perhaps the remnants of a
                                    label.</condition>

                            <p>The Augustinian Priory of Holy Trinity, Ipswich: although there is no explicit medieval evidence of provenance, it is
                                highly likely that the roll was made by and subsequently was held at the priory. The list of tenants begins with
                                property in the parish of St Margaret's and 'Thingstead', locations closest to the site of the priory.</p>

                            <p>The roll likely remained among the muniments of the Christchurch manor, formed from the estate of the priory at its
                                dissolution in 1536. The first membrane bears an inscription, perhaps of the 18th or 19th century: 'Rent Roll Christ
                                Church Estate St Margaret Ipswich'. W.P. Hunt, in his 1847 transcript of the roll's contents, claimed to have
                                accidentally found this and another roll (now Ipswich, Suffolk Record Office, HD1/9/1/4/1) among the muniments at
