                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">Comprising several parts of separate production, each written in cursive scripts by late medieval hands,
                                and assembled into a composite volume of complex structure by an early modern collector, this manuscript yields its
                                information only to the most persistent researchers. When M.R. James came to describe the manuscript in 1902, he spent
                                two pages of his catalogue listing the contents increasingly briefly, defeated perhaps by its complexities and its
                                'many hands, none very good', and ultimately dismissed the entire final section as 'receipts and miscellaneous notes,
                                save at the end in a hand like that of Dr See [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>, for 'Dee']' (ff. 238-302). The Librarian of
                                Trinity College, W.W. Greg, had similar difficulties, describing ff. 1-82 as simply 'a rough collection of tracts,
                                verses, and receipts, of a medical character and rather confused', written '<hi rend="strikethrough">mostly</hi> in a
                                    <hi rend="strikethrough">good</hi> plain hand'. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">As James and Greg observed, Trinity College MS O.1.13 is devoted mainly to medical recipes and
                                treatments, but, because of the nature of its production and the challenge its contents present, it has not received
                                the level of scholarly attention that other manuscripts have attracted. This is partly due to persistent aesthetic
                                biases, which Elaine Treharne detected in manuscript studies. Scientific and medical manuscripts are not usually known
                                for their visual appeal, in terms either of illumination or of script. In consequence, they are generally described in
                                negative terms, catalogued haphazardly, and edited infrequently. A further obstacle is that many are at once composite
                                volumes and miscellanies. Composites comprise two or often more parts of different origins and dates of production,
                                which may have been assembled in stages by different owners, and potentially long after the individual parts had been
                                made. The reasons for their assembly are not always apparent, and therefore it can be difficult to capture effectively
                                the spirit or purpose of the volume as a whole. The miscellaneous contents - of the individual parts, and of the whole
                                - are in turn difficult to navigate. As Arthur Bahr observed, a miscellany is 'a complex assemblage of textual parts
                                that does not obligingly present readers with a clear program or straightforward purpose'. This certainly rings true
                                for scientific and medical texts, and for MS O.1.13 specifically: it does not stand out visually, it is a materially
                                complex assemblage of at least ten parts, and its miscellaneous contents resist easy identification and
                                classification.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">There is, however, much to appreciate about this manuscript: a veritable treasure trove of largely
                                unedited texts, each awaiting the attention of researchers. There are more than 600 pages crammed full of medical,
                                culinary and alchemical recipes, and medical, herbal, horticultural and uroscopic treatises, and some miscellaneous
                                writings as well. The recipe collections reveal the captivating realm of medieval medicine, and the intriguing
                                aetiology of diseases: tooth decay described as being caused by worms, and the need for a remedy 'ffor any qwyke
                                thynge that is cropyn into a mannys ere' (f. 70r). These texts feature a blend of human and veterinary medicine; of
                                diagnostic, preventative and curative medicine; of recipes, charms, prognostication and divination; of remedies for
                                both physical and spiritual, natural and supernatural complaints. The medical recipes in particular utilise an array
                                of powders, syrups, pastes, treacles, baths, herbs, potions, salves, waters, poultices, purgations, plasters,
                                ointments, juices, oils, prayers and incantations to treat pains, aches, fevers, fractures, stones, worms, wounds,
                                coughs, palsies, swellings, fluxes, sores, incontinence, dropsy, gout, bleeding, baldness, insomnia, speechlessness,
                                epilepsy, pestilence and necrosis, among many others. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The new description of the manuscript's contents, presented here by Clarck Drieshen, is so comprehensive
                                that it marks a significant improvement on early descriptions such as M.R. James's, and even upon more recent,
                                outstanding work such as by Linne Mooney for the Index of Middle English Prose. The textual units are identified in
                                detail and in collections of short texts (such as the recipe collections) stand-out items have been described
                                separately, especially those that appear incongruous in the immediate context. Thus, many of the charms and magical
                                items in the medical recipe collections have been identified, to which may be added two strange remedies in the recipe
                                collection on ff. <locus from="145r" to="154v">145r-154v</locus>. This collection is a series of short recipes on a
                                variety of common complaints, but on f. <locus from="151c recto" to="151c recto">151c recto</locus> matters take a
                                sinister turn. Among the recipes on this page, one is 'for a blaste of a wykked spyryt', which the recipe asserts
                                manifests as a physical swelling in the face, and the next recipe is 'ffor the fyr of hell', which is a type of skin
                                inflammation sometimes identified as erysipelas. What these two recipes have in common with charms and magical recipes
                                is that they connect the natural and supernatural realms. Charms and magical recipes often remedy complaints with a
                                natural aetiology by supernatural means, whereas the two recipes on f. 151c recto seem to remedy complaints with a
                                supernatural aetiology by natural means. Presuming supernatural causes or prescribing supernatural cures stands out to
                                us, because the supernatural is now not usually associated with medicine. Yet in medieval medical contexts, the
                                natural and the supernatural were not categorically separate, although it is not uncommon for charms in medieval
                                recipe collections to have been censored by later readers, in particular by religious reformers of the 16th
                                century.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Many of the texts in MS O.1.13 circulated widely in the late medieval period, as the indices of Middle
                                English writings by George Keiser and Linne Mooney demonstrate. The treatises on rosemary, some of the recipe
                                collections, the poem on leechcraft, the lunaries, the poem on phlebotomy, the zodiacal texts and the horticultural
                                treatises are attested in ca. 15-25 manuscripts, suggesting that the scribes of what was to become MS O.1.13 drew on
                                an accepted body of scientific and medical learning. With so many text witnesses and scientific and medical
                                manuscripts, it becomes possible to identify clusters of late medieval scientific and medical sources that were
                                produced under similar conditions, as Linda Voigts did for the so-called 'Sloane Group' of manuscripts (see <bibl><ref
                                        target="https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-TRINITY-COLLEGE-O-00001-00077/1">Cambridge, Trinity College, MS
                                        O.1.77</ref></bibl> for one such textual cluster from this group). Some parts of MS O.1.13 may likewise be
                                connected to other manuscripts, through two potential clusters. The first consists of a poem on phlebotomy or
                                bloodletting, days of the moon good or not good for bloodletting, thirty-two perilous days and prognostications for
                                weather based on the appearance of the moon and sky (ff. 20r-21r). <bibl subtype="external" type="MS"><ref target=""
                                        >London, British Library, Sloane MS 963</ref></bibl>, ff. 71r-73v, has an identical cluster, in the same
                                order, in the same words, in the same script and in a contemporary hand. A connection between MS O.1.13 and Sloane MS
                                963 is further corroborated by a second cluster, consisting of a tract on the four humours and the method for
                                interpreting dreams using a psalter (f. 23r). Humoral lore and dream divination is not exactly an obvious pairing of
                                texts, yet an identical cluster of texts occurs twice in Sloane MS 963, ff. 13r-13v and 55r-55v. This particular
                                version of the method for interpreting dreams occurs only in the first part of MS O.1.13 and Sloane MS 963, which
                                makes a connection between the two manuscripts even more likely. </seg>

                                            that Part 8 (ff. 238-285) may consist of a few codicolocal units but since the collation for this part has

                                    invokes the names of the Three Magi. Once the amulet has been written, gold, myrrh and frankincense should be put
                                    in and the amulet closed up and hung around the sufferer's neck. The patient should be blessed, and when he rises
                                    in the morning he should say three Pater Nosters and three Ave Marias, and every day for a month drink three roots
                                    of peony with stale ale. Further instructions describe a cure if the sufferer is a child: that the names of the
                                    Magi should be written in the child's blood in a 'masere' (i.e. a drinking bowl) and washed with either ale or
                                    milk, and the mixture given to the child to drink. </note>

                                    <p>The collection also features a recipe for Weapon Salve on (ff. <locus from="88r" to="88v">88r-88v</locus>) that
                                        is attributed to Paracelsus (1493–1541): <q>Vnguentum ad vulnera Parakel[sis]</q>. Further references to
                                        Paracelsus occur in the collection's alchemical recipe (e.g. see f. <locus from="111v" to="112r"
