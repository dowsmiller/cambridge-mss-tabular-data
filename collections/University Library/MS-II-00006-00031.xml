                           >The Book of Privy Counselling</hi>. It is unique among the ten surviving copies for presenting the text on its own;

                     <seg type="para">Phyllis Hodgson consulted this copy for her basic text edition, but deemed it 'obviously unsuitable', as the
                        text is 'much modernised in vocabulary and spelling' (Hodgson (1944), p. xxiii). The version of the text in this manuscript is
                        distinctive, since it concludes with an additional passage that only appears in three other extant copies, suggesting that
                        they shared a common exemplar (the manuscripts are: <bibl subtype="internal" type="MS"><ref target="">Cambridge, University

                        Given the late date of the manuscript, it is difficult to pinpoint specific localising features, as the language is moving
                        towards a more standardised form (see Date for notes on vowel change and pronouns). It has some southern features, such as the
                        forms 'shall' and 'shulde', which, according to <hi rend="italic">eLALME</hi> distribution maps, were most highly concentrated
                        in the Midlands (<ref target="http://archive.ling.ed.ac.uk/ihd/elalme_scripts/lib/create_feature_map.php?mapid=0220004">

                        </ref> Dot Maps, 'SHALL, SHOULD: sh- (shal, shulde)' [accessed 12/03.19]). The southern '-eth' third-person singular present
                        verb ending is used throughout throughout the manuscript, but also appears in the first and second person forms ('me
                        thynketh', and 'thee thynketh'). Overall, the manuscript's dialect may be best described as what Jeremy Smith terms
                        'colourless written English', a less regionally diverse form that arose at the end of the fifteenth century, in line with the
                        increasing elaboration of English (see Jeremy Smith, 'From Middle to Early Modern English', in <hi rend="italic">The Oxford
                           History of English</hi>, ed. by Lynda Mugglestone (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), pp. 147-79, (p. 165)).</seg>

                           <hi rend="bold">Hand:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is one scribe throughout. The hand is a large, clear, highly legible Gothic bookhand, well-spaced, with a set aspect.
                           There is a close resemblance to <term type="script">textura quadrata</term>, as the minims have distinct diamond-shaped
                           feet, but there are also multiple features of <term type="script">bastard anglicana</term> which make it difficult to
                           designate a single script. The ascenders are particularly long, especially in the case of 'k' and the barred double 'l';
                           'h' is often crossed with a bar, which does not necessarily indicate an abbreviation, and its limb consistently descends
                           below the ruled line. Both long 's' and the 'st' ligature are used, the 'g' is closed with a separate horizontal stroke,
                           and the 'y' has a long descender, which curves to the right. The closed double compartment 'a' is typical of the gothic
                           script, whereas the 'w' is closer to the Anglicana form. There are consistent otiose strokes at the end of words,
                           particularly following 'r', 's' and 't'. The spelling reflects the later date of the manuscript: 'th' replaces þ/thorn,
                           which is retained only for the 'þat' abbreviation. The hand changes slightly in size and aspect through the manuscript. The
                           text on f. <locus from="4r" to="4r">4r</locus> is notably smaller, for example, and on f. <locus from="47v" to="47v"
                              >47v</locus>, lines 6-10, the hand briefly becomes extremely pointed and angular, and uses bifurcated ascenders,
                           two-shaped ‘r', and a capital 'a' composed of two curved strokes. </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="bold">Abbreviations:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The scribe uses a number of common abbreviations throughout. ‘þ<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>' is used for 'þat', and 'w<hi
                              rend="superscript">t</hi>' for 'with', most commonly in the forms 'w<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>in' and 'w<hi
                              rend="superscript">t</hi>out'. Macrons are used to denote missing 'm' and 'n' in both the English main text and the
                           Latin rubrics. A macron is also used twice on fol. 3v above 'both', to indicate a missing 'o'. In one instance (f. <locus
                              from="47v" to="47v">47v</locus>), a barred 'p' is used to indicate 'er' in 'perfectly'. </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="bold">Punctuation:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The scribe uses a punctus throughout, to indicate both the end of the sentence and caesura. The colon is also regularly
                           used, along with virgulae, to mark caesura. Parentheses are occasionally used, as on ff. <locus from="62v" type="62v"
                              >62v</locus> and <locus from="64r" to="64r">64r</locus>. </p>

                           'curious'; 'onyd' as 'united'; 'nakydly' as 'purely'; 'boistiously' as 'unfaindedly'. Batman underlined passages and marked

                           from notes on content, such as 'Against imaginations of passions, that one passion hath wrought redemption' (f. <locus

                     <p>The manuscript was dated by Margaret Connolly to the 15th century (see IMEP 19, p. 229). I suggest a date of production of the
                        late fifteenth century, based on characteristics of the hand (see 'Script' for further description), and features of the
                        spelling and vocabulary in comparison with the standard edition, which is based primarily upon the earlier copies of the text
                        at the British Library. The most notable differences are the use of the 'th' digraph in place of þ/thorn, evidence of vowel
                        change ('o' becomes 'u', as in 'bot'/'but'), and modernised vocabulary ('them', in place of 'þoo').</p>
