                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">Although the two parts of this manuscript are unrelated - in terms of their origin and their textual
                                contents - they have shared a history together since at the least the middle decades of the sixteenth century. The
                                pagination of the manuscript in an orange-red crayon, running continuously from its beginning to its end and across
                                the two parts without interruption, immediately marks the book out as formerly belonging to Matthew Parker
                                (1504-1575): one-time Master of Corpus Christi College in Cambridge, Archbishop of Canterbury during the reign of
                                Elizabeth I, and donor of books and manuscripts both to his former college and to the University Library.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The pagination also continues without interruption from MS Dd.1.10, the partner volume of this
                                manuscript, which contains the first portion of the so-called 'False Decretals' of pseudo-Isidore. The two portions of
                                this text may originally have been bound together; there is no obvious codicological evidence to suggest otherwise,
                                with the opening leaves of the text of MS Dd.1.11 being clean and well-preserved. Certainly by the time of the
                                manuscripts' donation to the University Library in 1574 they were bound in two volumes: they are recorded separately
                                in <ref target="https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/manuscripts-university-archives/subject-guides/medieval-manuscripts/early">the list of Parker's gifts</ref>, and a binding label preserved from that time and now affixed to <locus from="[ii] recto" to="[ii] recto">one of the endleaves</locus> at the front of the volume describes it as '2
                                pars'. It is not known whether the other text contained in MS Dd.1.11 - Nicholas Trevet's commentary on Boethius's
                                    <hi>Philosophia consolatio</hi> - had been bound with the False Decretals prior to Parker's possession of the
                                volumes; neither part of MS Dd.1.11 contains any evidence of provenance prior to that relating to Matthew Parker (and
                                nor does MS Dd.1.10). It may be that Parker brought the two parts together simply for the sake of convenience, their
                                leaves being of similar size with wide enough margins for them to be bound together and trimmed at the edges without
                                any loss of text.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">According to Paul Hinschius's 1863 edition, however, the text of the False Decretals found in MSS
                                Dd.1.10-11 had been copied from a twelfth-century manuscript from Christ Church Cathedral Priory in Canterbury (now
                                    <bibl subtype="external" type="MS"><ref target="http://searcharchives.bl.uk/IAMS_VU2:IAMS040-001102569">British
                                        Library, Cotton MS Claudius E.v</ref></bibl>, which itself ultimately derived from a now lost or unidentified
                                manuscript at Bec in northern France, but supplemented with papal letters held at Canterbury, including forgeries
                                produced during the episcopacy of Lanfranc). No doubt this led M.R. James to speculate in an unpublished description
                                of the manuscript that the copy in MSS Dd.1.10-11 "will have been written perhaps for an Archbishop of
                                Canterbury...possibly for [William] Warham" (see Source for further details). Numerous of Parker's manuscripts did
                                indeed come from libraries in Canterbury (though not always directly), however in this case definitive proof of the
                                book's production remains elusive.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The False Decretals was one of a series of compilations of canons and ordinances (legal decrees that
                                determined how the church should operate), not all of which were genuine either: these earlier collections are known
                                as the 'Collectio Hispana' and the 'False Capitularies'. It begins with a preface authored supposedly by 'Isidore
                                Mercator', an imaginary persona whose name derives from the combination of two genuine early Church authors, Isidore
                                of Seville and Marius Mercator. The principal invention of the False Decretals was a body of nearly a hundred
                                pseudonymous papal letters (known as 'decretals'), ranging from the papacy of Clement I to that of Gregory the Great,
                                and assembled by extracting and reconstituting the text of other, genuine sources. As Cotton MS Claudius E.v
                                illustrates, the False Decretals were also subject subsequently to further expansion with church law documents that
                                had particular local relevance or in order to serve specific political purposes.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The precise date and place of origin for the False Decretals remains open to debate among canon law
                                scholars, however. It has long been agreed that these texts emerged from the western region of the Frankish empire,
                                with further confirmation being given by the discovery that the originators of some of the forgeries annotated and
                                used three ninth-century manuscripts, two of which were from the monastic library at Corbie. They were first cited
                                definitively at the Council of Quierzy in 857, and given very wide circulation thereafter (more than a hundred
                                manuscript copies are still extant), forming the basis of the Church law across Europe until the sixteenth century. It
                                was only in 1628 that the fictional nature of much of their content was proven by the scholar David Blondel. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The second part of this manuscript stands in stark contrast to the first. Here, the authorship of the
                                text is certain, and much is known not only of the author's life but also of the circumstances in which he came to
                                write this text. Nicholas Trevet was born at some point between 1257 and 1265, and began his career in the Dominican
                                order in his young adulthood, first at the London convent and then, in the late 1280s, at Oxford. There he first
                                established his reputation as a scholar and, at an early stage (possibly before 1300), began spending time overseas,
                                most likely at other Dominican studia.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The earliest datable work to emerge from these travels was the commentary on Boethius's <hi rend="italic">De consolatione philosophiae</hi>. The text must date from before 1304, since Trevet quoted parts of it in his
                                quodlibet of that year, perhaps before he incepted as regent master at Oxford in 1303, and maybe as early as the turn
                                of the century. A prefatory dedication (not commonly found in the surviving manuscripts) reveals that it was written
                                for a fellow member of the Dominican order, a teacher and subsequently close friend of Trevet's, apparently an Italian
                                named Paul who lived in Pisa. Although Trevet had been urged to undertake the work by his mentor, it was only once he
                                was in Florence that he did so. At first struggling to find a copy of the <hi rend="italic">De consolatione</hi>,
                                Trevet eventually had to make one himself, using another lent to him by an unnamed third party, presumably a resident
                                of Florence. Both received presentation copies from the author in thanks.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">According to Edmund Silk, in his unpublished edition of the text, 'Trevet's purpose [in the commentary]
                                is to help students grasp the plan of the <hi rend="italic">Consolatio</hi> as a whole, and the relation of the parts
                                to the whole'. He drew widely on previous authors and commentators, in particular William of Conches, in order (as
                                Lodi Nauta has put it) to 'extract the <hi rend="italic">sententia</hi>, the deep meaning...[which] could be
                                co-ordinated with the <hi rend="italic"> sententiae</hi> of other authorities'. The citation by Trevet of his
                                commentary in his second quodlibet in 1304 indicates that his work on Boethius and involvement in university were
                                interconnected: the commentary was not simply an exposition of the text, 'but could also function as a vehicle for
                                expounding views which found their way into his university disputations' (Nauta).</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Characteristics that Trevet's commentary shares with the False Decretals are its wide dissemination and
                                lasting impact. More than a hundred copies of the text survive, although there appears not to be a published list
                                (though Silk mentioned that one was being compiled by Ruth Dean). It was used by a number of translators of Boethius,
                                most notably by Geoffrey Chaucer (a copy of whose translation has been part of the University Library's collections
                                since at least c. 1424, and is now <ref target="https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-II-00003-00021/1"> MS
                                Ii.3.21</ref>), but also Robert Henryson and John Walton. Its influence also continued beyond the manuscript era,
                                informing and influencing the earliest printed commentaries of Pseudo-Aquinas and Badius Ascensius.</seg>

                                <p>The Parkerian pagination that begins in MS Dd.1.10 - the partner volume of this manuscript - continues without
                                    interruption in MS Dd.1.11. This suggests that the manuscript may once have been bound in a single volume and up
                                    until the time it was in Parker's possession. However, by the time of its donation to the University Library, the
                                    manuscript was bound in two volumes: the two were recorded separately in the list of Parker's donations (see
                                    Acquisition) and this volume contains a binding label that describes it as '2 pars' (f. <locus from="[ii] recto" to="[ii] recto">[ii] recto</locus>).</p>
