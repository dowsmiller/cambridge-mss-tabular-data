                                        <p>The collation formula provided here disagrees with that provided by M.R. James on several points and the
                                            numbering consequently does not correspond with the quire numbers that have been written in pencil in the
                                            lower right-hand corners of leaves postulated to be the first in a quire. After the first five quires,
                                            James proposed that Quire 6 comprised ten leaves, suggesting tentatively that the tenth leaf had been
                                            cancelled. In fact, these are two separate gatherings: Quire 6, a bifolium; and Quire 7, a quire of eight
                                            leaves. What James recorded as Quire 9, which he thought comprised ten leaves with the tenth leaf
                                            cancelled, is instead a quire of ten leaves, of which the last two are missing, recorded here as Quire 10.
                                            This caused a further discrepancy in James's descrption of his Quire 10, which he thought to be a
                                            gathering of four leaves; it is in fact a gathering of six leaves, of which the last has been cancelled,
                                            and is recorded here as Quire 11. It may be that the binding of the manuscript at the time did not allow
                                            James sufficient access to the structure of the leaves to describe the manuscript's collation accurately.
                                            The new collation in this record also does not correspond with the quire numbers that have been added to
                                            the the lower right-hand corners of the first rectos, which follow James's collation. </p>
