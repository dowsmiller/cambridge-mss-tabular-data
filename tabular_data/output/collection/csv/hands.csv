Christ_Church_MS_88_hand_3,manuscript_3962,Christ Church,Christ_Church_MS_88,Christ Church MS. 88,,Christ_Church_MS_88,,"The scribe of this manuscript has been said to be the ‘Master Scribe’ of the scriptorium at Buildwas in its early years: Jennifer M. Sheppard, ‘The Twelfth Century Library and Scriptorium at Buildwas: Assessing the Evidence’ in Daniel Williams ed., England in the Twelfth Century (Woodbridge, 1990), 193–204 at 198–201, and ead., The Buildwas Books: Book Production, Acquisition and Use at an English Cistercian Monastery, 1165-c. 1400, Oxford Bibliographical Society 3 ser. 2 (Oxford, 1997), 4. She identifies him as the copyist of the final sections of another Buildwas book, Cambridge: Trinity College, MS B.1.3 (Gregory, Homeliæ in Ezechielem), a manuscript in which the opening flyleaves are discarded leaves in a script which Sheppard attributes to the ‘Flyleaf Scribe’ who, she hypothesises, was a fellow pupil of the ‘Master Scribe’. However, though there are similarities between the script here and her ‘Master Scribe’, there are enough differences to query the attribution. The differences are both in letter-forms – there are shared features in thegbut they are formed rather differently, with our scribe placing the lower bowl a little to the right of the upper bowl – and in presentation, with the last scribe of Trinity MS B.13 writing slightly above the line, while our scribe writes on it. Overall, the aspect of the script in this manuscript is more accomplished. Given the near-contemporaneous production of the two volumes, this is unlikely to be a reflection of increasing ability; it may rather be that our scribe was the master to the so-called ‘Master Scribe’ – and to the ‘Flyleaf Scribe’ who, it might be added, is so close in style to the ‘Master’ that the two are surely one. The role of our scribe as overseer would also explain Sheppard’s plausible supposition that our scribe produced not just the initials in this volume but also one in a further Buildwas book, London: Lambeth Palace Library, MS 109, fol. 16 (Gregory, Moralia; reproduced in 1990 as plate 18, and, in 1997, as figure 2, in both instances as from fol. 12).",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To him, about thirty books have been attributed in a series of articles by J. B. Trapp. Meghen’s career in England was underway in 1502 (when he copied what is now New Haven: Yale University Beinecke Library, MS Osborn a50 – a codex unknown to Trapp – for Christopher Urswick); in subsequent years, he was routinely employed by Erasmus and John Colet, and, after 1528, he worked in and around the court, first for Wolsey and Nicolaus Kratzer, the king’s astronomer, then as ‘Writer of the King’s Books’. See Trapp’s ‘Notes on Manuscripts written by Peter Meghen’, Book Collector 24 (1975), 80–96; ‘Pieter Meghen 1466/7–1540 scribe and courier’, Erasmus in English 11 (1981–82), 28–35; ‘Pieter Meghen, yet again’, Manuscripts in the Fifty Years after the Invention of Printing (London, 1983), 23–28. Trapp gave his most extensive listing of Meghen’s books in ‘Notes’, where (91–92) this manuscript is no. 15, and the companion volume, Oxford: Magdalen College, MS lat. 223, no. 14.

And the hand of the contents tables for individual items, here also writing textual openings so as to set a pattern for the scribe, is Thomson’s ‘master-scribe’ whom he designates ‘Scribe A’, probably the director of the abbey scriptorium and responsible for portions of several other codices.

Lowe about its origins; the latter’s letter in response, dated 9 December 1929, is kept at the front of the volume; in it, he suggests ‘the curious errors of spelling make one think of the province of Venice. It is quite likely it was written in the Veneto, and then migrated to the province of Lombardia’. The supposition of a Veneto origin was repeated by Owen himself in print (‘A Manuscript of Ovid’s Heroides’, Classical Quarterly, 30 (1936), 155–69 and 31 (1937), 1–15, with discussion at very first page).

The round script is also used for fol. 54v/1–7, two lines in the lower margin of fol. 56v and notes in margins elsewhere. The scribe of the round script therefore seems to have been a corrector and perhaps wrote the lines before and after the major initials because they included unfamiliar square and rustic capitals as well as the minuscule script (which, however, another scribe did well on fol. 65v, using the angular script).1 Watson's Plates.

Lat. 95,,Lincoln_College_MS_Lat_95,,"All the hands involved in the manuscript belong to the later thirteenth century, writing small, Italian cursive minuscules, much abbreviated. Boyle & Boyle dubbed the scribe of the Paris scriptum Hand A and the scribe of the reportatio Hand B. They named a further hand the Corrector. In fact, several men contributed to the main text. Preserving the current designation, we would identify Hand A1 (fols. 3ra–97vb), Hand A2 (98ra–116vb), and Hand A3 (117ra–123va). The first of these, who wrote most of the manuscript, is characterized by a leftwards lean and round, rather irregular forms; there are changes of ink and nib throughout his stint, but ductus and letter forms remain the same. Hand A2 is smaller, tighter and more consistent and, in spite of its tiny size, has more weight and definition. Hand A3 in aspect is something of a return to A1, but more upright and regular with different letter choices, notably a large, round s in terminal position rather than the leftwards leaning tall s found earlier.",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,cursiva,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lincoln_College_MS_Lat_95_hand_2,manuscript_16035,Lincoln College,Lincoln_College_MS_Lat_95,Lincoln College MS. Lat. 95,,Lincoln_College_MS_Lat_95,,"Shortly after the manuscript was written, Hand B received it and added the reportatio in the wide margins at the outer edge and the foot. It is a small, thin glossing script in a light brown ink. It is clear that this scribe had the book first since all other corrections to the main text in other hands are subsequent, having to be fitted around Hand B’s work; only scribal self-correction of the main text ever stands in the way of Hand B. There is a strong argument for identifying this scribe as Iacobus Raynucii OP, who died in 1286 as bishop of Florence. He was an early owner of the manuscript and may have been one of Thomas’s students at Santa Sabina (see History). Johnson, ‘“Alia lectura fratris thome”’, 61, found a similarity between this hand and one in BAV MS Vat. lat. 781, a scribe who took over from one of Aquinas’s habitual secretaries, thereby raising the possibility that our scribe was likewise a member of Thomas’s retinue. (This specimen is illustrated by A. Dondaine, Secrétaires de saint Thomas, 2 vols in 1 (Rome 1956), pl. 18, dubbed Hand o.) While undoubtedly similar in aspect, the two hands are not the same, as is revealed by the many differences in duct and handling as well as individual letter forms (the g, for example, is very distinctive to each hand).",,,,,Iacobus Raynucii OP,person_4916,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parkes, plate 13.ii, English Cursive Book Hands 1250-1500 (Oxford, 1969; rpt. 1980)). The first scribe wrote fols. 1-209v, stopping halfway down the page at line 1239 of The Kingis Quair, and probably also fol. 229r (see below). The first leaf of the manuscript is a cancel and replaces the original (presumably lost) first page of Troilus and Criseyde. Whether this leaf was written by the same scribe at a later date or a third scribe has been the topic of debate (see R.K. Root, 1914; W.A. Craige, 1940). The identity of this scribe has been suggested by George Neilson (1899) as the Scottish scribe James Graye, although this has been refuted. The first scribe’s hand has been identified in three other Scottish manuscripts: National Library of Scotland, MS acc. 9253; St John’s College, Cambridge, MS G.19 (187); and an unnamed late fifteenth-century Latin and Scots manuscript in the possession of the Right Honourable the Earl of Dalhousie. The second scribe wrote fols. 209v-228v. The identity of this scribe has been linked with ‘V. de F.’ whose name appears in Part VI of Cambridge University Library, MS Kk.1.5, but this is unconfirmed. The hand of fol. 229 closely resembles the first scribe, and potentially once belonged to a now lost quire which was originally bound earlier in the manuscript. The short poems on fols. 231v-230r are in another hand (or hands) to the main scribes.",2,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,secretary,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typical double-compartment a, long r, looped ascenders on d, l, b, and h, and sigma-shaped s.

However, though the hands are certainly contemporary there are inconsistent graphs between the Ashmole hand and Brode's hand, for instance: the Ashmole tight anglicana g vs Brode's hour-glass secretary g, the Ashmole long r that opens at the baseline vs Brode's long r that is open from the bottom, the Ashmole sigma s with long horizontal extension in final position vs Brode's narrow sigma s, the Ashmole downwards flourish to the of crossbar vs Brode's short crossbar, and the Ashmole single-stroke ampersand vs Brode's ampersand with suspended crossbar. Instead, it is likely that the two scribes are contemporary and trained in a similar milleiu, but are not the same individuals. For the identification of Brode's hand in MS Digby 181 and MS English 113, see Daniel W.

Features are two forms of two-compartment a: a variety with parallel sides and horizontal cross bar with a scooped stroke forming the head (used mid-word), and a variety that resembles an upper case graph with angular body and looped head (used for the indefinite article and word-beginning); looped d with angular lobe and long trailing tag when in final position; two compartment g with diamond-shaped head; two forms of looped h: an angular variety with triangular closed head-loop and long curving tail-stroke, and a rounded variety when following t or g where the head-loop follows on from the cross bar of the previous letter; both long and short zetoid r; and both long and short sigma s at word-end. Several speculations can be made about the nature of the scribe's copying. The strapwork initials are characteristic of legal and government scribes in London in the 1520's and 30's (see Perkins, 2015, p. 1; Meale, 1996, p. 226). The quality of the script and consistency of the hand (despite the lack of ruling) also suggest an individual experienced in copying long-form codices. A significant degree of planning was required for the layout and mise-en-page to ensure that every iteration of Leve we now coincided with the first line of the page.Works by William Fitzwilliam are autograph, in a messy secretary script of the sixteenth century. Features are single compartment a; long diagonal f with trailing descender; both long and short s; and unlooped y with exaggerated right-curling descender. Multiple stints in varying shades of ink can be identified throughout.",1,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,cursivaAntiquior,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typical double-compartment a, looped ascenders on d, l, b, and h, and sigma-shaped s. The g closed with a separate crossbar and the angular looped d with a triangular lower lobe suggest a hand with Secretary influences of the second half of the fifteenth century, perhaps the third quarter. In their edition of Lydgate's Lives of Ss Edmund and Fremund (2009), Anthony Bale and A.S.G. Edwards identify this scribe's hand in two other fifteenth century manuscripts of this text: British Library, MS Yates Thompson 47 and an un-numbered manuscript owned by the Duke of Norfolk. Bale and Edwards suggest this scribe was based in Bury St Edmunds, either within the Abbey or in a secular environment.Kathleen Scott identifies a total of ten manuscripts containing this hand, which she dubbs the 'Edmund-Fremund scribe', all containing works by Lydgate ( Lydgate's , 1982). Four of these are copies of Lives of Saints Edmund and Fremundthe Lives of Saints Edmund and Fremund. There is ongoing debate regarding the full extent of the scribe's contribution to British Library MS Harley 2255.The Quarto Catalogue suggests the manuscript shares a scribe with the presentation copy of The Lives of Ss Edmund and Fremund, British Library MS Harley 2278, however a comparison of the scripts suggests they were copied by different individuals, although likely in the same environment in Bury St Edmunds. MS Harley 2278 can confidently be dated to between 1434 and 1444 (due to its connection to Henry VI and his sojourn at Bury St Edmunds Abbey in 1434), whereas MS Ashmole 46 suggests a date of several decades later after 1461 (due to the replacement of references to Henry VI with the name of Edward IV). The dates therefore also make it unlikely that these two manuscripts shared a scribe.",1,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,cursivaAntiquior,,,,,,,,,,,,

MS_Bodl_180_hand_1,manuscript_1238,Bodl,MS_Bodl_180,MS. Bodl. 180,,MS_Bodl_180,,"One hand. An English vernacular minuscule of the twelfth-century, which retains features of the first half of the century, such as headless a and tapered ascenders still upright. Insular g is used throughout, whilst insular alternates with long ss and no ligatures appear to be used. The writing is regular and large in aspect. Ker argued that this manuscript was 'not well written' (Ker 1957, p. 359), but the scribe controls his or her hand throughout the quires, spacing minims and individual letters well. The height of the minims is regularly 3 mm. The prayer at the end is written most likely by this hand. Sedgefield suggests that: A close examination decides against the identity of two hands, which however may belong to the same school of handwriting (Sedgefield 1890, p. xv). The hand of the prayer is different in aspect, because the scribe seems to write faster and pays less attention to the formation of the individual letters and the pen is cut with a thinner nib, but it is very likely that these two types of script belong to the same scribe. Probably this text was copied at a later stage, but certainly at the same time as the corrections were inserted. Brown Ink. a: insular, with a large lobe, occasionally the head protrudes on the left; b: with wedged, slightly forked ascender with a straight back and a rounded lobe; c: one broken stroke with a curled head; d: two broken strokes and a thick upright back stroke, which tapers at the top end, but curls to the right at the point of junction with the left stroke of the bowl. e: insular small rounded and closed with a little tongue on the right side, more evident in final position. f: a distinctive insular form: straight upward shaft finishing occasionally with a little curl towards the right, otherwise closing with a fourty-five degree angle. Two dot-like-strokes form the horizontal strokes on the left. A little serif protrudes from the top of the back of the shaft. g: insular, with an s shaped descender which curves towards the right just after the writing line, and turns flat into an open lobe on the right topped by a flat horizontal stroke. h: Caroline with a thick wedged and slightly forked ascender and a right limb which sometimes curls under the line. i, m, n and u: minims are traced one at a time, regular in shape and their feet always finish with a small serif to the right. l: Caroline form with a tall wedged straight ascender, the shaft ends on the line with a foot curling to the right. o: rounded, oval shaped closed. p and ƿ are mainly distinguishable through meaning. However, ƿ is formed with a wedge-like head and a tailed descender curving towards the left and a closed elongated lobe. r: insular form, with a well defined bow and a descender which ends curving on the left, but finishing with a square or perpendicular angle. s: insular form, with a straight descender below the line of writing, occasionally curving to the left. t: straight head-stroke and straight shaft which curls to the right. y: is always dotted and the descender curves to the left finishing in a thin tail. The second stroke to the right is done quite high up near the start of the shaft. æ: formed by an insular a and an e which sits on the shoulder of the a and terminates with a tail on the top right. ð is formed like d, with rounded bowl and upright ascender, but the median stroke is not always straight; it mostly curves from the left to the right finishing with a tail and then a dot below the tail itself, but still attached to the stroke. There is another type of ð which appears more frequently towards the end of the manuscript. The basic formation is the same, but the scribe forms the left side stroke of the bowl to meet the ascender and then continues to finish with a tail curling leftwards. þ is upright with wedged ascender and a tailed descender, and a pointed head-stroke.Capitals are enlarged form of the minuscule with the exception of A, which sometimes is a large two-compartment letter.Litterae Notabiliores of the main chapters of the table of content are decorated with dots, but written in the same ink as the text by the main hand.Use of tironian nota; crossed through þ for þæt; a macron usually abbreviates m, n.

More substantial corrections appear, for example, on fols 12v, 14v, 55v, 58v, 62v.

The letter d has two forms, one Anglicana with a looped ascender, the other a form with a triangular body, and an ascender consisting of the lengthening of the right hand side of the triangle. This ascender is straight and has no loop, and shows the Secretary influence in the hand. The g is still the typical 8-shaped two compartment one of Anglicana. Of the letter r we find four forms, the long r, and three 2-shaped varieties, resembling v, z and 3 respectively. Initially and medially we find long s, finally short s. The letters y and thorn are clearly distinguishable. The y is not dotted but has a descender curving to the right and is differently shaped from the thorn. Yogh is used and has the flat-topped 3-shape, much like the z. This hand does not feature any Anglicana forms of w, but consistently has the simple Secretary variety. It is a firm and clear, upright script. The loops are generally rounded rather than angular.

Germ. e. 22,,MS_Germ_e_22,,"Hand 1, fols. 5r–233r: Cursiva Libraria – a very distinctive, skilled and, considering the time of creation, extremely conservative hand which shows the following features: single compartment a; excessive and stringent use of looped ascenders at h, b, l and k; ascender of d looped to the left; g not looped; descenders of f and straight s below the baseline (as well as last minim of h); dotted y (single dot); umlaut written with one or two dots above the letter; highlighting done either by rubrication, underlining in rubrication or rubrication of single letters. A comparison to other documents from St. Nikolaus in undis shows that this type of script was a ‘corporate design’ of St. Nikolaus in undis (see, for example, Strasbourg, Archives de la ville et de l’Eurometropole, II,39/14–16, II,41–42a/6, II,42b/12). Comparing the manuscript to the hands of different nuns from the convent makes it appear possible or even likely that it was written by Susanna Brünnin, who from the 1570s until the closure in 1592 had been last prioress of the convent and was jailed by the protestant city authorities in 1594 (Anna Sauerbrey, Die Straßburger Klöster im 16. Jahrhundert (Tübingen 2012), 307f, 43, 402–412; Thomas Lentes, Gebetbuch und Gebärde.

Ein Beitrag zur Straßburger Bibliotheksgeschichte (Tübingen 1957), 116–118; Amy Leonard, Nails in the Wall. Catholic Nuns in Reformation Germany (Chicago, 2005)). An account book and several documents that can clearly be ascribed to Brünnin (mostly part of the convolute Strasbourg, Archive de la ville et de l’Eurometropole, II,39/17) show the same distinctive handwriting. The manuscript Strasbourg, Bibliothèque Nationale Universitaire de Strasbourg, ms. 2748 (a collection of devotional texts titled ‘Geistliche Wirtschaft’ which is very similar to this manuscript) also appears to have been written by this hand.",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,cursiva,libraria,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, the a here is resolutely double-bowled, with its head rising above the height of the minims; the d is always curve-backed with a single bowl; the r sometimes takes the short ‘z’-shaped form, though it is more often upright with a rounded foot; the s also takes two usual forms: unless at the end of a word, it is long with a simple structure, having a small curved head and curved foot of equal size; final s is nearly always short and double-bowled, though occasionally at the end of the line justification is achieved by forming it with one open stroke that tails away at the line (fol. 77, ll. 30 & 32). The aspect of the script is fairly regular, with the emphasis on thick strokes, on short ascenders and descenders, and on closely packed letters, with frequent biting; a repeated feature is the addition, passim, of thin diagonal strokes which serve three purposes: first, they provide a flourishing bifurcation to the ascenders of b, h and l; second, they are always used to ‘dot’ the i; third, they regularly perform the function of a hyphen, marking the split of a word at the line-end.",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,textualisNorthern,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hatton 36, fols 2–119",,,"Throughout this section of the manuscript, Clamanges also makes corrections and additions, both by erasing and rewriting and words and by adding phrases in the bottom margin (introduced by a range of signes de renvoi). In the marginalia, he employs two scripts: the first has been described as “influencée par l’humanistique” [Ouy, “Manuscrits Autographes”, tav. ii] and it is certainly less distant than the text itself from his ‘italianising’ experiments, especially with its tall straight ascenders, but its orthography remains predominantly gothic (see, for example, the g which lacks the spikiness of the book-hand but is still formed of two conjoined bowls: fol. 4v, 10 etc; the final s on occasion is formed by one stroke descending below the line – eg. fol. 35v, 48v, 58–but is most often double-bowled: fol. 4v, 8v, 10, 41, 56, 58, 71; other examples of such marginalia occur at: fol. 11, 35v, 48v, 81v, 99, 101, 112v). It is this script that also adds corrections on or between the lines (eg. fol. 3, 6, 10, 11v, 12, 14, 22v, 28, 55v etc). The second script is a clear French secretary book-hand, with a single-bowled a, a loop on the ascender of the l, and a slanted, shaded long s (fol. 72, 73v).Clamanges also adds the rubricated titles to each of the articles in this fascicule.",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,humanistica,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are generic similarities with the script of section A, but the script in this section is more calligraphic, with a tendency to more complex letter-formation. The minims usually turn to the right, especially at the end of words; descenders are short but reach down to the line, while ascenders are notably short and have small bifuractions (less strident than those in section A). Of particular letters: the a takes two forms, the more frequent being a rather square double-bowled letter, similar to that in fascicule A, but there also appears here a construction with a large lower bowl and an upper lip which a thin diagonal stroke closes into a triangular upper-bowl (cf. fol. 129v, line 3 etc); the ascender to the d is confined to a whisp that hardly rises above the head of the minims; the g is formed with a large upper bowl with beneath it a small loop closed by a thin diagonal stroke; and while s at the start or middle of words is tall, but with a ‘v’-shaped foot, the final s is double-bowled, each bowl being lozenge-shaped. The same script is used for the rubricated title at the opening of the item.The differences between this script and that of fascicule A would allow this to be by a scribe other than Clamanges, but even if this is the case, the author is still present in this section of the manuscript, providing interlinear corrections in his hand (fol. 121v, 124v, 127, 128, 129v, 131, 132v, 134v) [these corrections, and the possibility that this section is not transcribed by the author, are noted in F.

Earlier attributions to South Italy seem to be erroneous, and Constantinople seems more likely to be the place of origin. For a discussion, see O. Smith, ‘A note on HH 88 and Marc. Gr. 622’, Maia 27 (1975) 205; id. 'The scribe of the MS Holkham Gr 88 in ‘Tricliniana II’, Classica et mediaevalia, 43, (1992), esp. p. 197 (fn. 27) and 207-209; D.

Smith argues that the scribe ‘obviously had access to some highly interesting and presumably very rare MSS’ and that he wrote possibly also the codex unicus of Hesychius Lexicon (MS Marc. gr. 622). He perhaps copied part of MS Benaki 20 (fols 4r-5r, 6r-6v and 189v-427v) as was suggested by A. Tselikas, Δέκα αἰῶνες ἑλληνικῆς γραφῆς (9ος-19ος αἰ.), Μουσεῖο Μπενάκη, Athens 1977, no. 35, pp. 44-45. Smith gives wrong numbers for Tselikas’ ref. and leaves the discussion open while he finally hints at Leo Atrapes (RGK II, 328, RGK III 383), a scribe active in Constantinople. Speranzi however examined further a hypothesis put forward by Fonkič in which Γεώργιος Χρυσοκόκης, RGK III, 127, active also in Constantinople, might be connected with the copyist of MS. Marc. gr. 622, as well as the scribe conventionally known as Anonymus EE or Anonymus 15, and speculated on possible connections with the monastery of St. John Prodromos of Petra in Constantinople as his source of the exemplars of these rare MSS (especially the Hesychius Lexikon and the Triclinian Aristophanes).

The MS was copied in Padua possibly ca. 1460–1470 by the anonymous Cretan scribe, who worked for Pietro da Montagnana. The codex was a copy of a 14th c. MS, which is now the second part of the composite MS Guelf. 82 Gud. G. As Gamba observes, it has to be pointed out that although Pietro had in his hands the 14th c. MS, he preferred to annotate the recent copy of the text (MS. Holkham Gr. 103). Examination also of the interlinear glosses reveals direct dependence on the Latin translation of Heroicus penned by John Argyropoulos while he was in Padua. This is now preserved in the MS. Marc. lat. XIV.54 (coll. 4328), fols 49r-66r. It is pretty sure that Pietro da Montagnana had direct access to this translation. The grammatical notes accompanying MS. Holkham Gr. 103 also testify to the fact that Pietro had at least adequate knowledge of Ancient Greek, for he provided his own translation whenever he had found Argyropoulos’ text to be less reliable.

Scribes 2 and 3 have historically been identified as the same individual, see Root 1914, Seymour 1995, and Windeatt 2023, but are here distinguished as two different hands: Scribal stints do not align with points of textual division or physical divisions in the manuscript, with the exception of folio 29, a singleton copied by scribe 1 which is on a different paper stock to the rest of the quire. Scribe 1: folios 1r-9v (Book I ll.1-700), 16r last four lines and 16v-19v (Book II ll.118-433), 29r-v (Book II ll.1044-1113), 59r last two lines and 59v-114r (Book III ll.1373-V.1869, and Balade to Rosamond on folio 114r), leaf signatures to quires 1, 11, 12, 13, and catchwords to quires 1(10v), 2(20v), 6-12. Notable graphs are the single compartment lower-case a, secretary g with separate cross bar, short kidney shaped s in final position, and short zetoid & with circular flourish. The first letter of the line is often flourished, and occasionally the first initial of the page. Scribe 2: folios 10r-15v and 16r except last four lines (Book I ll.701-Book II ll.117), leaf signatures to quire 2. Notable graphs are tall slanted upper-case A, short sigma s with pronounced horizontal stroke in final position, and distinctive & with curled descender below and detached flourish and dot above (similar to type 93 according to Tschichold, 1953). Scribe 3: folios 43r-51r and 51v first nine lines (Book III ll.306-912), leaf signatures to quire 5 and one signature of 13 (f.107r), and catchword to quire 3. Notable graphs are tall upright upper-case A, elongated sigma s with large body in final position, and short cross-shape & with curved descender (type 94 according to Tschichold, 1953). Descenders on the final line of each page are often elaborately flourished. Scribe 4: folios 20r-28v (Book II ll.434-1043), 30r-42v (Book II ll.1114-Book III ll.305), catchword on folio 31v, and leaf signatures to quires 3 and 4. Notable graphs are secretary g with separate cross bar and right curving descender, short unlooped h with short curved descender and ascender, and a mixture of simple short zetoid & (type 83 according to Tschichold, 1953) and short cross-shape & with curved descender (type 94 according to Tschichold, 1953), as scribe 3. The first letter of each line is flourished, and the first letter of each page is occasionally decorated with elaborate scrolls in black and red. Scribe 5: folios 51v except first nine lines and 52r-58v and 59r except last two lines (Book III ll.913-1372), and catchword to quire 5. Notable graphs are slanted short sigma s with broken stroke in final position, horned p with open body and angled descender, short form of r, and short cross-shape & with minimal descender (type 80 according to Tschichold, 1953).

The Tremulous Hand added glosses; mostly in a later phase of his career as his hand is 'particularly large and trembly', but earlier versions of his hand are also found scattered throughout (Franzen 1998, p. 28). Franzen 1998 (p. 28) notes ‘nearly contemporary additions to the text and glosses are found in several hands … which are often difficult to distinguish’ from those by the Tremulous Hand.
