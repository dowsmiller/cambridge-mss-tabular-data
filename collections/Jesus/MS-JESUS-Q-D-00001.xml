                            <seg type="para">This manuscript begins and ends with four parchment leaves (ff. <locus from="1r" to="4v">1r-4v</locus>
                                and <locus from="161r" to="164v">161r-164v</locus>: Part 1) that have been taken from a late 13th- or early
                                14th-century legal manuscript and recycled as flyleaves for this 15th-century medical manuscript. While M.R. James
                                dated the leaves to the 14th century, the dates of the law cases and features of the script leave open the possibility
                                of an earlier composition around c. 1300.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The core of the manuscript (ff. <locus from="5r" to="160v">5r-160v</locus>) consists of paper leaves with
                                watermarks that are difficult to identify due to their poor visibility. Throughout, there are medical works and
                                medical recipes in Latin and Middle English that were copied by various 15th-century hands, possibly with some
                                marginal additions made in the early 16th century. Although the core of the manuscript may originate from a single
                                milieu or location, it is possible to identify at least three parts that may have been produced separately from one
                                and another: ff. <locus from="5r" to="69v">5r-69v</locus> (Part 2); ff. <locus from="70r" to="123v">70r-123v</locus>
                                (Part 3); and ff. <locus from="124r" to="160v">124r-160v</locus> (Part 4). That these three parts were created
                                independently of one another is suggested by differences in their layouts, scripts, and quire numbers. Nevertheless,
                                they were almost certainly joined together by the end of the 15th century: the same 15th- or 16th-century hands can be
                                identified among the marginal annotations in all three parts.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">What is known about the manuscript suggests that its parts were created and owned in the East of England.
                                While Middle English dialectal features point towards Suffolk and Norfolk [see Language(s)], the manuscript's earliest
                                known owners may have been members of the Spelman family of Narborough, Norfolk [see Provenance]. </seg>

                                    (2016) transcribes this item as part of a subsequent recipe for a mouthwash. Nevertheless, there is no obvious

                                    that added the synonyma to margins elsewhere in the manuscript.</note>
