                                    <p>This catalogue record contains several early modern and modern foliation and pagination sequences. These are
                                        each described in turn below as Foliation Sequences 1-3. In order to produce a useable sequence for the
                                        present digital catalogue record (for which unique folio numbers are required), some of these sequences are
                                        followed (wholly or in part), while others are ignored. The prefatory numbers (i.e. '1:', '2:', etc) refer not
                                        to the relevant Foliation Sequence, however, but to the Part of the manuscript in which they are found. </p>
                                    <p>The resulting, amalgamated foliation sequence is as follows: [i]-[ii] + 1:1-1:57, [1:57a], 1:58-1:59 [cf.

                                <note>Full transcription. Four accounts about monstrous creatures as told by eye-witnesses to the author (who is
                                    probably also the scribe). According to Timmermann (2015), these accounts are alchemical allegories. The first
                                    account tells about a winged dragon from the mountain of <q>Baux</q>, perhaps Les-Baux-de-Provence, that was seen
                                    flying over <q>Pugeol</q>, perhaps Pujols, Southwestern France. The second account is about a huge adder at
                                        <q>Bederide</q>, probably Bedarrides near Avignon in Southeastern France. The third account is about a
                                    three-headed serpent that was killed at a castle at <q>Bayon</q>, perhaps Bayonne in Southwestern France. The
                                    fourth and final account tells about a great eel and his serpent compagnon and is partly set in Avignon,
                                    Southeastern France, referring to a cardinal <q>Armoniac</q>, perhaps Georges d'Armagnac (b. c. 1501, d. 1585),
                                    who was appointed cardinal in 1544.</note>

                                    <p>Some of the recipes feature titles and words that are written in a cypher. In the usual encryption method,
                                        vowels have been replaced for their preceding or successive letters in the alphabet (e.g. <q>opxr ifs fscrpfs

                                            >2:8v</locus>). In another encryption method, vowels have been replaced with the letter <q>q</q> where the
                                        number of horizontal strokes through its descender represents the numerical value of a vowel (e.g.
                                            <q>[q2]mpl[q1]str[q2] p[q4][q5]r t[q4][q5]t[q4]s [q5][q4][q2]g[...] vlceros</q> [=emplastre pour toutos

                                        method, both consonants and vowels appear to have been scrambled with their preceding and/or successive

                                    the placename <q>Shepherdswell</q> is a corruption of <q>Sibertswalt</q>, first recorded in the Domesday Book.

                                        <q>Shipriswold</q> in 1501, <q>Shepswold</q> in 1506, and <q>Sheperterwold</q> in 1522. Another hand has
