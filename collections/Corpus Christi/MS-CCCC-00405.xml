                            <seg type="para">Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 405 (hereafter CCCC MS 405) is a complex composite manuscript
                                formed from several originally separate booklets, some of which exhibit signs of originating from the same source, or
                                having been brought together relatively soon after their creation, due to the appearance of annotations by the same
                                scribe in more than one part. With the exception of the parchment and paper endleaves (ff. <locus from="a recto"
                                    to="a verso">a</locus>, <locus from="i recto" to="i verso">i</locus>, <locus from="ii recto" to="ii verso"
                                    >ii</locus>, <locus from="b recto" to="b verso">b</locus>), the majority of the present codex was owned by (and
                                probably brought together by) the community of the Knights Hospitaller of St John of Jerusalem at Waterford in Ireland
                                by the middle of the fourteenth century at the latest. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The medieval sections of the manuscript date from the 13th and 14th centuries and contain a wide variety
                                of textual material, including liturgical forms, charters and legal customs, calendars, poems, and treatises on virtue
                                and vice. The manuscript contains texts in both Latin and variants of medieval French, with linguistic divisions
                                largely conforming to the genres of the texts, i.e., legal and liturgical material in Latin, and poems in medieval
                                French. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">Although CCCC MS 405 is a composite volume - and one that has suffered evident losses, particularly in
                                the latter part of the codex - it is apparent that at least two scribes worked on more than one part of the
                                manuscript. CCCC MS 405 'Scribe 1' writes a heavy textualis with long horizontal serifs and wedges on his ascenders
                                and seems to have been responsible for ff. <locus from="3v" to="5v">3v-5v</locus>, <locus from="43r" to="92r"
                                    >43r-92r</locus>, <locus from="127r" to="230v">127r-230v</locus>. CCCC MS 405 'Scribe 2' writes a neat late
                                protogothic / early textualis and was responsible for ff. <locus from="8v" to="10r">8v-10r</locus>, <locus from="125r"
                                    to="127r">125r-127r</locus> and ff. <locus from="231r" to="245r">231r-245r</locus>. This detail about the
                                recurring scribes does not seem to have been discussed in scholarship before, and would benefit from further research
                                in order to better understand the complex construction and use of this volume. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">CCCC MS 405 became part of the Parker Library collection through the bequest of Archbishop Matthew
                                Parker, a former Master of the College who amassed a large collection of manuscripts in the latter years of his life.
                                MS 405 bears evidence of the interest of Parker and his circle in the book: folio <locus from="ii recto" to="ii recto"
                                    >ii recto</locus> contains a selective list of the contents of the volume on an inserted paper leaf in a
                                16th-century hand found in several other Parker Library manuscripts with no prior shared provenance, indicating that
                                the list was added by Parker or one of his circle while making a study of the manuscripts collected for Parker's
                                research on the history of Christianity and ecclesiastical practices in the British Isles.</seg>

                                        f. iii verso and 385, f. i verso). The numbers at the start of each lemma refer to the Parkerian pagination

                                    <p>Smallwood, in his discussion of the <hi rend="italic">The Prophecies of the Six Kings to Follow John</hi>
                                        offered a general description of the Anglo-Norman texts on ff. 3v-10v and suggested that this regnal list must
                                        have been copied c. 1325/26, i.e., in the 18th regnal year of the reign of Edward II. Edward II is the final
                                        king in the regnal list, and in the list, Edward is said to have reigned for 18 years. King Edward II reigned
                                        for 20 years (1307-1327), but a scribe writing in the reign of Edward II would have only been able to state
                                        the duration of Edward's reign at the time of writing, e.g., 18 years which places the date of the composition
                                        of the regnal list c. 1325/1326.</p></note>

                                        Rome', but as five Popes with the papal name Leo have been canonised (I, II, III, IV, and IX), it is unclear
                                        which Pope Leo is meant in the text). The closing lines of the text however, describe the text as a copy of
                                        the letter of Jesus to King Abgar of Edessa. The text is usually descibed in modern scholarship as an
                                        apocryphal letter of Jesus to King Abgar. </p>
                                    <p>The text suggests that people suffering from illnesses 'si homme seyt malade' should wear the letter around
                                        their neck 'pendet set bref autour sonn cole' in order to achieve relief from their symptoms.</p>
                                    <p>The text contains a formula of address, where a person performing the charm asks for help on behalf of another
                                        person, and in this letter, the intended recipient of the benefit of the charm is named in the text as
                                        'William', 'assistunt hinc famulo tuo +Willelmo+ hoc scriptum portanti'; no further information is known about
                                        the identity of this William. </p></note>
