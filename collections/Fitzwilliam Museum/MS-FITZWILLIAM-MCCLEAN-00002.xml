                     <seg part="N" type="para">This richly illuminated <title>Greek Gospel lectionary</title>
                probably dates in its earliest portion to the second half of the
                11th century. One scribe was responsible for copying the <hi rend="italic">menologion</hi>, containing the lection sequence
                for the fixed calendar, beginning from 1 September, and another
                for the <hi rend="italic">synaxarion</hi>, containing the
                lections of the mobile calendar, beginning from Easter. Both
                sections are provided with elaborate decoration with extensive
                use of gold, but the style differs between the two, showing that
                in this too they were the work of different hands.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">It is unclear whether the two components were
                produced as part of a single project but assigned to separate
                teams of scribe and artist, or if they originated in separate
                projects. In the latter case, they could be portions of two
                different original lectionaries which were created independently
                but later combined when both were damaged or left incomplete, or
                one section could have been produced purposely to supply what
                was now missing from the other. The script of the menologion
                seems if anything the earlier, while that of the synaxarion
                could date from the same 11th-century period but would also be
                consistent with a 12th-century origin. Therefore it is likely
                that if either was created to replace losses to the other it was
                the synaxarion which was produced to supplement the menologion,
                but contemporaneous production is also plausible. Early quire
                signatures are present in the synaxarion, but only a few
                survive, while none are present in the menologion, so no clear
                evidence of the manuscript's origins can be derived from
                these.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">At a later date, two replacement quires were
                produced to supplement losses from the synaxarion, ornamented in
                a somewhat simpler style but still with extensive use of gold.
                The text of these quires is in an unusual, very square script
                which is not easily placed chronologically but perhaps dates to
                the 14th century.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">There have been significant further losses from
                the manuscript, and the surviving portions are now bound out of
                order. The menologion sections for December and January appear
                out of sequence at the very beginning of the manuscript, while
                the early folios of the synaxarion are severely
                disordered.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">Unusually, the manuscript contains portrait
                miniatures of the Evangelists, which appear within the
                menologion. Two of these survive, depicting Matthew (<locus from="1v" to="1v">f. 1v</locus>) and Mark (<locus from="20v" to="20v">f. 20v</locus>). Such miniatures are a feature much
                more commonly associated with Gospel books, in which the text
                appears in its original order, than with lectionaries. Their
                inclusion within the menologion also seems less natural than it
                would be in the synaxarion, in which the calendar outside of
                Holy Week is divided into sections each dominated by readings
                from one of the four Gospels, whereas the four are interspersed
                throughout the menologion.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">The inclusion of the miniatures also seems to
                have led to some disruption to the copying of the text. The
                portrait of St Mark was painted on a single folio which was then
                inserted into a quire, as was common practice, but for some
                reason when the scribe reached this point they broke off copying
                the lection which was interrupted by this folio and began
                copying it again on the next folio after that bearing the
                miniature. Still more peculiarly, this lection was followed by
                the repetition of another lection which had already appeared a
                few folios earlier. This disruption offers a notable insight
                into the working process of the manuscript's production, since
                it indicates that the extra folio bearing the miniature was
                inserted into the quire before it was copied rather than
                afterwards. It remains unclear why the scribe thought it
                necessary to begin the current lection again after the
                miniature, while the repetition of another lection directly
                afterwards is still more perplexing.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">The presence of the Evangelist portraits could
                conceivably account for the current erroneous placement of the
                menologion sections for December and January, since this places
                one of the miniatures on the very first folio of the manuscript,
                while the other appears within the last quire of the displaced
                section. This suggests that they could have been placed at the
                beginning of the manuscript for greater prominence, by a modern
                owner who was not going to be using it for liturgical
                purposes.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">Still more unusual than these full-page
                miniatures is a small miniature of the Virgin Mary which appears
                in the division between the two columns of text on <locus from="154v" to="154v">f. 154v</locus>. This is placed
                alongside the beginning of the lection for the feast of her
                Nativity on 8 September.</seg>

                      and the rest are quaternia. Quire 6 is composed of the
                      last folio of a quire otherwise lost (<locus from="33r" to="33v">f. 33</locus>), which originally preceded Quire
                      5, bound together with a bifolio detached from Quire 5
                        (<locus from="34r" to="35v">ff. 34-35</locus>). The
                      correct sequence of these folios runs ff. <locus from="33r" to="33v">33</locus>, <locus from="27r" to="27v">27</locus>, <locus from="34r" to="34v">34</locus>, <locus from="28r" to="31v">28-31</locus>,
                        <locus from="35r" to="35v">35</locus>, <locus from="32r" to="32v">32</locus>. The first folio of Quire 6 is thus
                      the first surviving folio of the manuscript in the
                      original sequence. The signatures indicate that a further
                      six quires have been lost before this and another one
                      between Quires 13 and 14. The signatures suggest that the
                      substitute Quires 17-18 (Part III) replaced a single
                      original quire.</p>
