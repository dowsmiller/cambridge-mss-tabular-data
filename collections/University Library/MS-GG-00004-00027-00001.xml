                            <seg type="para">There are several reasons why MS Gg.4.27(1) (hereafter 'Gg') occupies a special place among early
                                manuscript copies of Geoffrey Chaucer's writings. It has however seen some vicissitudes during its long life, which
                                need to be mentioned. Compiled somewhere in East Anglia (probably not far east of Cambridge) a couple of decades or so
                                after the poet's death in 1400, Gg constitutes the only surviving attempt to gather most of his poems between the
                                covers of a single book, before collected editions of his works began to appear in print in the early 16th century.
                                Like a few other Chaucer manuscripts, Gg was once extensively illustrated and decorated, but sadly most of the leaves
                                carrying the artwork were cut out sometime during the sixteenth century, carrying away with them significant
                                quantities of the text. Chaucer's language was by this time becoming increasingly difficult for readers to understand,
                                especially so in the shape of the East Anglian dialect of Gg's main scribe, and the manuscript might well have been
                                discarded or used as a source of scrap parchment, as was the fate of many other medieval books. Fortunately, in or
                                around 1600, it was rescued by an Elizabethan antiquary named Joseph Holland, who set about rectifying some of the
                                damage, and 'improving' the manuscript in other ways. Among other things, he commissioned <locus
                                    from="Additional leaves: front cover, outer" to="Additional leaves: front cover, outer">replacement leaves</locus>
                                to supply the parts of the text that had gone missing during the previous generation, together with a glossary, an
                                engraved picture of Chaucer as a 'title page', and some account of the life of the poet. Most of these materials came
                                from a new collected edition of Chaucer's works that had been published by Thomas Speght in 1598.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">It was in this strange hybrid state that Gg reached the University Library, probably in 1664, as part of
                                the collection of Richard Holdsworth, who had been Master of Emmanuel College. There it remained, relatively
                                undisturbed, until the mid-19th century, when it came to the notice of Henry Bradshaw, at first a keeper of
                                manuscripts and subsequently University Librarian, who possessed the distinction of being not only the most
                                accomplished bibliographer of the time, but also its most knowledgeable student of Chaucer's writings. In 1865,
                                Bradshaw decided to return Gg as far as possible to its original state. With great care and skill he disbound the
                                manuscript, and removed the leaves inserted by Holland to the back of the book, establishing in the process its
                                original construction, and the continuity of the texts. In addition, he brought to light various features of the book
                                which have since further enhanced its interest and importance, notably the fact that it contains a unique revised
                                version of one of Chaucer's most accomplished and characteristic poems, the <hi rend="italic">Prologue to the Legend
                                    of Good Women</hi>; and, moreover, that it had originally included at least one full-page picture. It is thus
                                essentially Bradshaw's reconstruction that we see when we open Gg.4.27(1) today. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">These, and no doubt other episodes in Gg's chequered past, have effaced whatever evidence it might have
                                contained as to who commissioned or compiled it, or who first owned it. It is however clear that, as an example of
                                early 15th-century bookmaking, Gg stands apart from the London metropolitan book trade that produced the kind of
                                up-market manuscripts in which Chaucer's writings were first transmitted, such as the Ellesmere Canterbury Tales
                                    (<bibl type="MS" subtype="external"><ref

                                        ><ref target="https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/dh967mz5785">Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS
                                        61</ref></bibl>). By contrast, art historians are of the opinion that Gg's illustrations are no less
                                'provincial' in style than the East Anglian dialect of its scribes. Whoever obtained the exemplars from which the
                                latter worked seems to have been a resourceful and perhaps well-connected admirer of Chaucer whose aim was to preserve
                                as far as possible his entire literary legacy. A separate copy of Chaucer's <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the
                                    Astrolable</hi> (spotted by Bradshaw in <bibl type="MS" subtype="external"><ref
                                        target="https://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/manuscript_9078">Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS. e Mus.
                                        116</ref></bibl>), which is also in the hand of Gg's main scribe, may have been part of the same campaign.
                                Gg's unique copy of a revised version of the <hi rend="italic">Prologue to the Legend of Good Women</hi> has been
                                mentioned, and its texts of the <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Parlement of
                                    Foules</hi> have been judged especially important by modern editors. The only major work that eluded the compiler
                                was the <hi rend="italic">House of Fame</hi>, and the early version of John Lydgate's <hi rend="italic">Temple of
                                    Glas</hi> (? c. 1420), included at the end of Gg, may have been intended as a substitute. The subject of the
                                    <locus from="130v" to="130v">missing full-page picture</locus> that originally stood between the end of Gg's copy
                                of <hi rend="italic">Troilus</hi> and the beginning of the <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</hi> also invites
                                speculation in this context. Might it have been another elaborate author portrait, similar to the celebrated
                                frontispiece to the deluxe copy of Troilus and Criseyde at Corpus Christi College, affirming Chaucer's identity and
                                status? </seg>
                            <seg type="para">Whatever the precise motives underlying the compilation of Gg, it plays a significant role in the origins
                                of a cultural tradition devoted to venerating Chaucer as the first recognisably great English author, and a distinct
                                literary personality. Joseph Holland's early modern attempt to reconstitute the book as such speaks to this impulse,
                                while two centuries or more later we find Henry Bradshaw industriously peeling away the later accretions and seeking
                                to restore what is left of the original monument, as it were. Bradshaw's activities sparked an interest in the
                                manuscript, which (as the accompanying bibliography shows) has continued actively down to the present day. Following
                                in Bradshaw's wake, F.J. Furnivall swiftly printed most of the contents in his series of Chaucer Society publications
                                during the latter half of the nineteenth century, and towards the end of the twentieth another landmark was reached
                                when the entire manuscript was published in a three-volume photographic facsimile, with an elaborate descriptive
                                introduction. The digital images furnished here constitute a further phase of development, and offer many avenues of
                                enquiry for the future. </seg>

                                        referred to as 'MS Gg.4.27.1' and the King Horn leaves as 'MS Gg.4.27.2'. See: Beadle (2019) for further
                                        details. (The separation of the final running number by a full-stop reflects 19th- and early 20th-century
                                        practice, though brackets were also in use during this period and is the preferred approach today). </p>

                                        around that same time. Bradshaw removed the leaves that Joseph Holland had added and assigned them a separate

                                        Stoakley (late Hawes) (see Binding for further details). These former covers are now preserved with the

                                        separately in a soft-cover parchment binding, and stored in a box marked 'MS Gg.4.27.1. Additional leaves'.
                                        The slips of paper that Bradshaw had added were also removed and preserved. In their place were added fresh
                                        sheets of parchment that signified missing or cancelled leaves (but see Foliation for further details).
                                        Mistakes in the ordering of the leaves that predated Stoakley's binding and Bradshaw's examination of the
                                        volume were also corrected, as follows: <list>
                                            <item>Quire 16: 3rd and 11th leaves missing: their stubs were previously bound as the 2nd and 10th leaves
                                                (hence Bradshaw's initial misnumbering of f. <locus from="184r" to="184v">184</locus> as '185', and f.
                                                    <locus from="192r" to="192v">192</locus> as '193').</item>
                                            <item>Quire 22: 6th leaf missing: its stub was previously bound as the 7th leaf (hence Bradshaw's initial
                                                misnumbering of f. <locus from="261r" to="261v">261</locus> as '260'.</item>

                                                introduced the practice of assigning folio numbers to leaves that he judged to be missing on the basis
                                                of the manuscript's collation. Unfortunately, in the case of MS Gg.4.27(1), Bradshaw's interpretation
                                                of the structure of the manuscript's leaves in Quire 25 changed: having previously thought that one
                                                leaf was missing after f. <locus from="302v" to="302v">302v</locus>, he later decided that two leaves
                                                were missing. As a consequence, his first foliation sequence was thereafter cancelled and a second
                                                sequence added that differed from the first by 1. Some this second sequence has since been
                                                over-written by a later hand.</p></note>
                                        <note><p>Although replacement leaves were added throughout the manuscript during its conservation, and
                                                although these technically carry a folio number (in accordance with Bradshaw's foliation practice),
                                                the foliation statement given above counts only medieval leaves and omits replacement leaves and stubs

                                                [109a], [118a], [123a], [123b], [430a], [430b], [493a], [508a], [515a]. As Parkes and Beadle (1979-80)
                                                explain (see vol. 3, p. 10), f. '444' is a questionable case. Bradshaw thought that a leaf was missing
                                                here, and thus assigned it a folio number: 'the recto could have contained the 'Retractions', and the
                                                verso would have been blank. However, the display at the foot of f. 443v could have been regarded as a
                                                colophon (the script is larger than that of other displayed headings and colophons in the Canterbury
                                                Tales...), in which case the leaf would have been blank'.</p>

                                            Quires 10 and 43 - are regular, though in both cases one bifolium is formed of two separate half-sheets.

                                <summary>The manuscript was copied by two scribes. Almost all of the volume was copied by one scribe (A). Only the
                                    final quire contains the work of both the main scribe and another (B). Importantly, a leaf copied by A is conjoint
                                    with a leaf copied by B, which indicates that - for this quire at least - the two were collaborating (rather than
                                    B providing replacements for leaves that had been copied by A and then discarded). Quotations in what follows are
                                    taken from Parkes and Beadle (1979-80), vol. 3, pp. 44, 46; further palaeographical analysis of scribal practices
                                    and orthography may be found therein (pp. 46-56), together with discussion of punctuation and abbreviation (pp.
                                    56-57) and correction (p. 62).</summary>

                                        to the volume, along with other matter relating to Chaucer or the text, some of which was taken from an
                                        edition of Chaucer's works published in 1598 by Thomas Speght. These leaves were originally bound in at the
                                        relevant places in the manuscript. For the subsequent rearrangement of the manuscript and the placement of
                                        these leaves, see Custodial History. These leaves are described below in Part 2, with digital images following
                                        those of the main volume, here described as Part 1. </p>
