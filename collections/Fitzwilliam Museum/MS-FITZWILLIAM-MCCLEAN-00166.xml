                            <seg type="para">Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, MS McClean 166 (hereafter MS McClean 166) contains three popular
                                astronomical and computistical texts: the <hi rend="italic">Algorismus</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Tractatus de
                                    sphaera</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Compotus</hi>, all by <name key="person_v84975906">
                                    <persName type="display">Johannes de Sacrobosco</persName>
                                    <persName type="standard">Johannes de Sacrobosco (fl. c. 1200-1250)</persName>
                                </name>, a popular medieval scientific author. The Sacrobosco texts are found on ff. <locus from="12r" to="71v"
                                    >12r-71v</locus> of MS McClean 166, and the remaining leaves contain a calendar, computus tables, annalistic
                                notes, a medical recipe, and a treatise on the use of the quadrant, a tool typically used for finding the altitude of
                                a celestial body. Both the treatise on the quadrant and the works of Sacrobosco are accompanied by neatly illustrated
                                diagrams to help the reader interpret the concepts discussed in the texts. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The date and location of production of the manuscript can be determined with relative accuracy due to the
                                annalistic material and the calendar. The list of important calendrical, computistical, and time-reckoning information
                                on f. <locus from="1r" to="1r">1r</locus> suggests that the notes were made c. 1279. The Julian calendar begins with
                                the birth of Jesus, and the notes on that leaf state that 1279 years have elapsed since that event. Jesus is
                                traditionally believed to have died in his 33rd year of life, and the notes also record that it has been 1247 years
                                since he was crucified. Subtracting the year 1279, from the number of years stated to have passed since the creation
                                of the world, 6479, gives a creation date for the world c. 5200 BCE, which also accords with calculations made for the
                                age of the world by St Jerome and Gregory of Tours. The annalistic information on f. <locus from="11v" to="11v"
                                    >11v</locus> includes computistical calculations for the years 1275-1386 and annals for the years 1274 and 788.
                                Taken together, the time-reckoning calculations and the annalistic material point to a date of production in the late
                                1270s. As M. R. James noted in his <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi> record for MS McClean 166, the location of
                                production can be inferred through details in the calendar found on ff. <locus from="72r" to="77v">72r-77v</locus>;
                                M.R. James noted that in addition to the major feasts typically found in almost every medieval calendar, the calendar
                                in MS McClean 166 includes several entries for local saints associated with the city of Verdun and the wider region of
                                north-eastern France, which suggests that the manuscript originated from that locale. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">MS McClean 166 has been trimmed and rebound since it was made and the leaves are not in their original
                                order. MS McClean 166 retains an original medieval foliation sequence, written in ink in the typical medieval form of
                                Hindu-Arabic numerals in the upper right-hand corner of the rectos, but the numerical sequence indicates that what was
                                once the final quire in the volume is now instead presented as the first. The first quire (ff. <locus from="1r"
                                    to="11v">1-11</locus>, original 5th leaf missing) has the medieval folio designations ff. 69-80 (69 largely
                                trimmed away, 73 absent due to loss of 5th leaf after medieval foliation), indicating that it originally followed the
                                present Quire 7, the final quire in the manuscript, which ends with the medieval designation '68' on what is now f.
                                    <locus from="77r" to="77v">77</locus>. It is not clear why the final quire was displaced, particularly as it means
                                that the Sacrobosco texts, which make up the majority of the volume, now begin later in the codex. </seg>

                                    tables were attributed to Grosseteste by S. Harrison Thomson in <hi rend="italic">The Writings of Robert

                                    known to Harrison Thomson. The tables have subsequently been rejected as authentic works of Grosseteste, and the
                                    canonical preface to the tables is now regarded as <hi rend="italic">dubia</hi> in more recent scholarship, such

                                <p>A bissextile year is a leap year. In the modern Gregorian calendar we add a leap day on the 29th March, but the
                                    practice of adding a leap day every four years (with minor adjustments) significantly predates the adoption of the
                                    Gregorian calendar in western Europe. The Romans also adjusted their calendars to the length of the solar year by
                                    adding an extra day to February every four years, but they did it by doubling the 24th of February, which was
                                    better-known in their calendar as the 6th day before the kalends of March (<hi rend="italic">ante diem sextum
                                        Kalendas</hi>), causing a doubled 6th day (before the kalends of March) i.e., a bis+sextile day. </p></note>

                                    the 25th of January, making the 'Egyptian days' for January the 1st and 25th of the month. Full

                                        foliation sequence was added as f. 1 in this medieval sequence is found on what is now the first leaf of Quire

                                                designations at the end of Quire 7 </item>
