                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">The manuscript is a composite item and consists of several parts: one two-leaf fragment, and three parts
                                consisting of one or more quires deriving from separate original manuscript sources. There is evidence to suggest that
                                all of the parts have been together since the later Middle Ages. First, a medieval collator added alphanumeric leaf
                                signatures in red ink in a sequence that crosses the composite parts of the manuscript. Secondly, one of the artists
                                who worked on Part 2 added flourished initials to the empty spaces left for initials in Part 4, see e.g., f. <locus from="63v" to="63v">63v</locus> (in Part 2) and f. <locus from="122v" to="122v">122v</locus> (in Part 4). There is
                                also evidence that quires have been lost from the volume since the composite parts were united. The current Quire 14
                                contains the first half of al-Khwarazmi's <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic</hi> in Latin, and catchwords on the last verso
                                of that quire f. <locus from="111v" to="111v">111v</locus> suggest that the text once continued onto a subsequent
                                quire, now lost. Separately, the current Quire 15 ends part of the way through Chapter 10 of Hermannus Contractus' <hi rend="italic">De utilitatibus astrolabii</hi>, and the opening of Quire 16 begins part of the way through Chapter
                                19 of that text, which suggests that there was once an intervening quire with the remainder of Chapter 10, through to
                                the beginning of Chapter 19 of that text. Both quires, however, must have been missing since at least the late middle
                                ages as the leaf signatures and catchwords of the medieval collator treat Quires 14-16 as a single sequence without
                                any gaps. </seg>

                                the text was once complete, but the second half of the text has since been lost. The text of the <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic</hi> is known only from this copy and one other: <bibl subtype="external" type="MS">New York, Hispanic
                                    Society of America, HC 397/726 </bibl>, the original Arabic version and all other Latin copies have been lost. </seg>

                                    <p>The manuscript is a composite item and consists of several parts: one 2-leaf fragment, and three parts
                                        consisting of one or more quires. The majority of the extant quires are gatherings of 8 leaves, with variation
                                        in quire size typically found at the beginning and the end of the parts. The 9th leaf of Quire 10 is an
                                        inserted singleton. The 5th leaf of Quire 13 is absent and may have been blank and later excised: following
                                        historic foliation practice at Cambridge University Library, this leaf has been assigned a folio number (f.
                                        102), though it is not certain that text is missing as a consequence of its removal.</p>
                                    <p>There are traces of at least two lost quires within the manuscript. The current Quire 14 contains the first
                                        half of al-Khwarazmi's <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic</hi> in Latin, and catchwords on the last verso of that

                                        quire, now lost. The current Quire 15 ends part of the way through Chapter 10 of Hermannus Contractus' <hi rend="italic">De utilitatibus astrolabii</hi>, and the opening of Quire 16 begins part of the way through
                                        Chapter 19 of that text, which suggests that there was once an intervening quire with the remainder of Chapter
                                        10, through to the beginning of Chapter 19 of that text. Both quires have been missing since at least the late

                                            parts of the manuscript; these signatures demonstrate that the manuscript has been in its current

                                    Bury St Edmunds, were almost certainly written there, but whether Quires 1-14 were written at Bury St Edmunds, or
                                    copied elsewhere and combined in Bury St Edmunds by the later middle ages is not clear.</p>
