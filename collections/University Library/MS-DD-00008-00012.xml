                            <seg type="para"> This manuscript is a composite volume and comprises a complete copy of the Bible in Latin made in
                                England in the first half of the 13th century accompanied by four later quires of exegetical material that helped
                                readers to understand the text of the Bible. These quires include Stephen Langton's <hi rend="italic">Interpretationes

                                    historiae in genealogia Christi</hi> ('Compilation of history in the genealogy of Christ'). They were probably
                                copied in the late 14th or early 15th centuries in England and were presumably incorporated into the volume soon after
                                their creation.</seg>
                            <seg type="para"> MS Dd.8.12 is one of the last examples of the 'Giant Bibles' produced in the Romanesque decorative style
                                in England in the Middle Ages. The latter half of the 12th century was the high-point of Giant Bible production in
                                England, and the surviving volumes are characterised by their generous dimensions, their preference for the pandect
                                format (i.e., the whole text of the Bible in a single volume), and their exquisite decorative schemes, which made
                                extensive use of opaque polychrome illustration, historiated initials with the figures and scenes typically enclosed
                                in rounded frames, and frequent use of gold as a ground and as a decorative embellishment. Famous giant bibles

                                format for bibles increasingly tended towards more compact volumes that prioritised comfortable consultation and
                                transport over monumental effect. </seg>

                                either the north Midlands or the north of England in the first third of the 13th century (see N. Morgan, <hi rend="italic">Early Gothic Manuscripts (1) 1190-1250</hi>).</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Before becoming part of the UL collection in 1664, the manuscript belonged to Richard Holdsworth, who was
                                the Dean of Worcester Cathedral at the time of his death in 1649. Holdsworth was a bibliophile, and by 1649 he had a
                                personal collection of c. 10,000 manuscripts and printed books. After Holdsworth's death there was a great deal of
                                legal disagreement as to the intended beneficiaries of the collection, but eventually, in 1664, probate was settled so
                                that the majority of the collection passed to Cambridge University Library.</seg>

                                        <p> The extant Quire 'a' is incomplete; the original 1st leaf is lost, 7 original leaves remain, and a
                                            parchment bifolium has been added. The first extant leaf of Quire 'a' (the second leaf of the original
                                            quire) has been used as the left pastedown by a binder, and has the designation f. <locus from="i" to="i">i</locus>. A parchment bifolium has been inserted into the gathering between the first and second
                                            extant leaves (now ff. i and 3 respectively), perhaps by the binder who used the first extant leaf as the
                                            left pastedown. The two leaves of the added bifolium have the designations ff. 1-2. The remaining leaves
                                            of the original Quire 'a' are foliated as ff. 3-8. In sequence and with reference to the foliation, the
                                            extant leaves are ff. i (left pastedown), 1-2 (inserted bifolium), 3-8. </p>

                                <note> The text referred to as '4 Esdras' in this manuscript (and generally so in western Europe in the Middle Ages)
                                    is now more commonly known as '2 Esdras'. The textual divisions of the medieval '4 Esdras' do not easily map onto
                                    the modern chapter and verse designations for 2 Esdras and so identification is made by comparing the textual
                                    content.</note>

                                        <p>The original structure of Quire 46 has been rearranged during later rebindings: a binder added a parchment
                                            bifolium after f. 467, then fixed the first leaf of the bifolium to the last extant leaf of Quire 46 with
                                            an adhesive and used the second leaf of the bifolium as the right pastedown. The original final leaf of
                                            Quire 46 (what would have been f. 468) is lost; due to historic foliation practice at Cambridge University
                                            Library, the lost leaf was included in the folio count when assigning folio designations, and so the
                                            foliation jumps from f. 467 to f. 469. The leaf-surfaces f. 467v and f. 469r are not visible as they are
                                            the interface by which the new bifolium was joined to the last extant leaf of Quire 46.</p>
                                        <p>The CUL foliator, contrary to typical practice assigned a folio designation (f. 470) to the right
                                            pastedown.</p>
