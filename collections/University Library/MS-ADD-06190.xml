          <head>Treatises on the soul</head>

          <msContents>
            <summary>
              <seg type="para">This manuscript offers an object lesson in some of the complexities that arise in the interpretation of evidence of
                origin and provenance. It opens with a series of Quaestiones, or discussion points, on Aristotle's treatise on the soul, <hi rend="italic">De anima</hi>. These were composed in the early 14th century by Jean de Jandun (c. 1285-1328), a French scholar and
                theologian who studied and taught at the University of Paris. There then follows a translation of <hi rend="italic">De anima</hi>
                itself, composed by the Greek philosopher and humanist, George of Trebizond (1395-1486), who was born in Crete and later settled in
                Italy. A colophon at the <locus from="110v" to="110v">end of the Quaestiones</locus> appears to record that it was written out at
                Oxford in 1441 by a <name cert="low" key="person_v" role="scr"><persName type="display">Thomas Clare</persName><persName type="standard">Clare, Thomas, fl. c. 1441?</persName></name>, who identified himself as a monk from the abbey of Bury St Edmunds.
                The remaining portion of the manuscript is written by the same hand, in a similar script. The quires were formed from the same paper
                stock and likewise use sheets of parchment for the inner and outer bifolia. The pages were prepared for writing in the same way and
                indeed the Quaestiones end and <hi rend="italic">De anima</hi> begins in the middle of the same quire. All of this points to the
                second text having been copied in near succession to the first - and for many years the manuscript was considered to be, according to
                Albinia de la Mare, a candidate for the status of 'the earliest dated English manuscript in humanistic script'.</seg>
              <seg type="para">However, John Monfasani has shown that there is evidence that one of the prefaces to George of Trebizond's translation
                was completed only in late 1446 or early 1447, and the entire work is unlikely to have circulated in England until later. '[T]he
                possibility must be considered,' Antonia Gransden concluded, 'that the volume is not written in Clare's hand at all, but is a copy
                made by another, rather later scribe of a (now lost) exemplar containing Clare's transcription of the Quaestiones, and that this
                scribe simply copied Clare's colophon.' Recent palaeographical analysis by David Rundle lends further weight to this judgement: the
                script contrasts markedly with other English engagements with humanistic handwriting reforms in the 1440s, its 'combination of
                features [being] reminiscent of English adoption of humanist cursive as seen in Rome and elsewhere from the later 1450s'. He suggested
                that the colophon could also have been a mistake, with '1441' written in error for perhaps '1471'. Orietta da Rold's research into
                paper stocks used in Cambridge University Library manuscripts of English production likewise points to later production: paper bearing
                a closely similar or possibly identical watermark is known to have been of French origin, and circulated between 1470 and 1482, with
                examples found in England in the third quarter of the 15th century.</seg>
              <seg type="para">Ruling out Thomas Clare as the scribe of this volume, and proposing a later date of production, allows other
                connections to be suggested, however. A Thomas Clare inscribed his name in a copy of Robert Holcot's <hi rend="italic">Moralitates</hi> (now <bibl subtype="external" type="MS"><ref target="https://archives.library.wales/index.php/moralitates-roberti-holcoth">Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS 8431
                    B</ref></bibl>), which was made in the mid-15th century and not later than 1477. This Thomas Clare identified himself in different
                places in NLW MS 8431 as 'dompnus' and 'monachus', but unfortunately part of one of these leaves has been torn away, and perhaps with
                it any evidence of his native house. He could perhaps have been the copyist of the exemplar from which MS Add. 6190 was made, but
                cannot have been the copyist of MS Add. 6190 itself: the hand in the inscription and in the text of the Holcot manuscript are very
                different to that found in the one shown here. There is an earlier Thomas Clare, who was ordained deacon in 1387 and become Doctor of
                Theology at Oxford in March 1414, and was also a monk at Bury, but he lived probably too early to have been copying the exemplar
                manuscript in Oxford in 1441, and seems in any case to have returned to the abbey by at least 1429, at which date he was involved in
                the election of a new abbot. There is a later Thomas Clare, recorded in the early 16th century, but nothing connects him to
                Bury.</seg>
              <seg type="para">The manuscript has been discussed among the books owned by the abbey at Bury St Edmunds and at the time of writing
                (2024) continues to be listed as belonging there in the most recently updated, online version of N.R. Ker's <hi rend="italic">Medieval
                  Libraries of Great Britain</hi> (<hi rend="italic"><ref target="http://mlgb3.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/mlgb/book/586/">MLGB3</ref></hi>).
                There was never any explicit evidence of MS Add. 6190 having been physically located at Bury - though, strictly speaking, property in
                the hands of monks belonged not to them but to their house, wherever the monks themselves might have moved (as Ker explained in his
                second preface to <hi rend="italic">MLGB</hi>, p. xxvi). If we conclude that the colophon was merely copied from the lost exemplar,
                then the elimination of Thomas Clare as the copyist of this manuscript must lead in turn to the rejection of MS Add. 6190 as a Bury
                book (though the exemplar itself, <hi rend="italic">ceteris paribus</hi>, would have been a Bury book, under the terms of monastic
                ownership explained above, and may also have been at the abbey at some point). If we conclude that the colophon was written in error,
                though, and should have read '1471', then MS Add. 6190 may tentatively remain linked to Bury. </seg>

              <p>The manuscript was previously thought to be 'the earliest dated manuscript in humanistic script', copied at <placeName key="place_g7011931">Oxford</placeName> in 1441 by Thomas Clare, a monk of Bury St Edmunds. However, subsequent dating of the
                translation of Aristotle's <hi rend="italic">De anima</hi>, together with palaeographical analysis and study of the paper stocks,
                points to a later date of production. The colophon may have been copied from the exemplar, thus eliminating Thomas Clare as the scribe
                and as Oxford as the location of this manuscript's production, or it may have been written in error, with '1441' instead of '1471'.
                The localisation of the manuscript's production to Oxford thus remains in doubt (see Provenance and Summary for further
                discussion).</p>
