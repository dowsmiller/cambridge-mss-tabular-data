                  <summary>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">This lectionary manuscript, produced in the 12th or
                                13th century, is notable in that it contains both Gospel lections
                                and those of the Pauline Epistles, whereas lectionaries usually
                                contained either the cycle of readings from the Gospels or that from
                                the Acts and Epistles. It is also unusual in that it contains only
                                the lections for weekdays of the <hi rend="italic">synaxarion</hi>,
                                the cycle of readings of the movable calendar, beginning from
                                Easter. <title>Greek lectionary</title> manuscripts generally contained
                                either the lections for the whole week (typically produced for use
                                in monasteries, where the liturgy was performed daily), or those for
                                Saturday and Sunday only (typically for use in non-monastic
                                churches). This suggests that it was created to supplement an
                                existing combined lectionary of the Saturday-Sunday type, or more
                                probably two separate Saturday-Sunday lectionaries, one for the
                                Gospels and one for the Acts and Epistles. Between them, these would
                                have included the lections of the <hi rend="italic">menologion</hi>
                                (the cycle of readings of the fixed calendar, beginning from 1
                                September) and the <hi rend="italic">synaxarion</hi> lections of
                                Acts as well as the Saturday and Sunday <hi rend="italic">synaxarion</hi> lections of the Gospels and Epistles.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">This division of content between Gospels and Epistles
                                is reflected in the physical structure of the manuscript, which is
                                composed of two separate parts which were clearly not originally
                                bound together in their present position. The first contains the
                                lections of the Epistles, the latter those of the Gospels. Both
                                parts are incomplete, as the first few folios of the Gospel
                                lectionary are missing, while that of the Epistles breaks off at the
                                end.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">The fact that the definite losses from each part occur
                                where the two parts meet one another in middle of the manuscript,
                                rather than the outer end, is an indication that they were not
                                previously arranged as they are now. This is confirmed by other
                                physical features of the second part. The corners of the folios are
                                curved inwards, whereas one would expect any such curvature to bend
                                them outwards. The corners of the earlier folios of this part are
                                also heavily worn, indicating that they were exposed at the
                                extremities of a book rather than being towards the middle of it, as
                                at present. On the first folio of this part (<locus from="2:6r" to="2:6r">Part II, f. 6r</locus>), there are marks from the
                                turn-ins of a binding, indicating that at some point it was located
                                at the end of a volume, evidently after the loss of its first few
                                folios.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">However, the consistency of material, script, ornament
                                and layout between the two parts, as well as their unusual weekday
                                lection content, indicates that these are not portions of two
                                unrelated manuscripts which have been bound together, but were
                                produced as parts of the same programme of work. They may have been
                                originally bound together as a single volume, in which the present
                                order of the two parts would have been reversed, or formed two
                                separate volumes.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">The parchment of which the manuscript is composed is of
                                notably poor quality, its folios containing numerous holes created
                                during the stretching process in the course of their production,
                                including some within the written area. Such leaves would usually
                                have been rejected for use in a manuscript produced in the
                                mainstream of the Byzantine world. It suggests at least a provincial
                                origin, and perhaps one in a peripheral area of the Greek-speaking
                                world, such as <placeName full="yes" instant="false" key="place_g4005365">southern
                                    Italy</placeName> or <placeName full="yes" instant="false" key="place_g7001519">the
                                    Levant</placeName>, though there are no specific indications of
                                production in either region. The scribe's unusual practice of using
                                small crosses as routine punctuation marks is another peculiarity
                                suggesting a possible origin outside the core of the Byzantine
                                world. Aspects of the scribe's technique or tools also seem to have
                                been at fault on occasion. There are folios where the pen has
                                repeatedly broken through the parchment during copying, leaving an
                                ink-blot on the far side. This could have been due to weak
                                parchment, too sharp a pen, or the scribe pressing it too hard. On
                                one occasion (<locus from="1:70r" to="1:70r">Part I, f. 70r</locus>)
                                this happened so many times while copying the lower part of the
                                recto folio that the scribe left the lower, blotted part of the
                                verso blank and continued the text on the next folio.</seg>

                           <condition>Some folios have been attached to paper stubs. The
                                        outer margin of <locus from="1:70r" to="1:70v">f. 70</locus>
                                        has been cut away, with slight loss of text. The lower
                                        margin of <locus from="1:78r" to="1:78v">f. 78</locus> has
                                        also been cut away. There are small tears to the edges of
                                        some folios, mainly among the last few (<locus from="1:96r" to="1:102v">ff. 96-102</locus>). The parchment has torn
                                        around the text in part of <locus from="1:76r" to="1:76v">f.
                                            76</locus> There is occasional discoloration of the hair
                                        side of a bifolio, perhaps due to poor preparation of the
                                        parchment (e.g. ff. <locus from="1:4r" to="1:4r">4r</locus>
                                        and <locus from="1:5v" to="1:5v">5v</locus>). There is also
                                        discoloration of some openings (e.g. <locus from="1:65v" to="1:66r">ff. 65v-66r</locus>). There are areas of
                                        serious brown water staining (e.g. ff. <locus from="1:11v" to="1:26r">11v-26r</locus>, <locus from="1:71r" to="1:78r">71r-78r</locus>), and milder water damage
                                        elsewhere. There are also some ink-blots and areas of dirt.
                                        During the copying of the lower part of <locus from="1:70r" to="1:70r">f. 70r</locus>, the pen frequently pierced
                                        the folio, leaving holes and ink-blots on <locus from="1:70v" to="1:70v">f. 70v</locus>, and as a result
                                        the scribe left the lower part of the verso blank. The same
                                        problem has occurred in a less severe form elsewhere (e.g.
                                            <locus from="1:66r" to="1:66v">f. 66</locus>). Some
                                        folios are creased. The text is significantly faded in
                                        places, and faded areas have sometimes been overwritten with
                                        black or bright red ink.</condition>

                                That they have been together from an early date is also suggested by

                                placed before Part I, and the marks of a former binding on <locus from="2:6r" to="2:6r">f. 6r</locus> indicate that even after the
