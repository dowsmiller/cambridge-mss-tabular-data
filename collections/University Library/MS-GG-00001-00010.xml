                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">This manuscript comprises three parts, all probably copied in the 12th century, perhaps in France. The
                                first part, which contains Cicero's <hi rend="italic">Somnium Scipionis</hi> (Dream of Scipio) and Macrobius' popular
                                commentary on the text, is probably the oldest part of the manuscript and was made perhaps in the first half of the
                                12th century. The <hi rend="italic">Somnium Scipionis</hi> is an extract from Book 6 of Cicero's <hi rend="italic">De
                                    re publica</hi> in which Cicero describes a dream vision of the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus. In the dream,
                                Scipio looks down on the city of Carthage from a vantage point in the heavens before turning his attention to
                                describing his celestial surroundings and offering a topography of the earth, sky, planet and stars. Macrobius' <hi rend="italic">Commentarium</hi> was an incredibly popular text in medieval western Europe and multiple copies
                                survive - most, like this manuscript, with diagrams that illustrate various portions of Scipio's description of the
                                heavens. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The second part of the volume, ff. 55-138, contains two extremely popular medical works attributed to
                                Mattheus Platearius: his Commentary on the Antidotarium Nicholai known as the 'Liber iste' and his <hi rend="italic">De simplicibus medicinae</hi> also known as the 'Circa instans'. The 'Liber iste' is a collection of glosses
                                (detailed explanations) on a popular medical text known as the <hi rend="italic">Antidotarium Nicholai</hi>. The
                                'Circa instans' follows the pattern of typical medieval European herbals, with a sequence of medicinal plants arranged
                                alphabetically and described according to their taxonomy and their uses in various preparations to treat specified
                                medical problems. Both the 'Liber iste' and 'Circa instans' are thought to originate from the milieu of the medical
                                school at Salerno in the second half of the twelfth century and so this part of the manuscript contains early copies
                                of the most up-to-date and respected medical information available in western Europe at the time.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The final part of the volume, ff. 139-140, is a fragment; the two leaves may have once been used as
                                binding waste as the majority of f. 140 has been torn away, and what remains has a visible coating of an adhesive on
                                the verso. Nevertheless, ff. 139-140 preserve several short medical recipe instructions and treatments, so it is
                                possible that the fragment has circulated with at the very least the preceding part of the volume for a long time on
                                account of the similarity of their content, with the two leaves perhaps serving as prepatory research notes, or a
                                place to collect later addenda. </seg>
                            <seg>It is not clear when all three parts of the volume came together. The two main parts were listed as one volume in
                                Edward Bernard's 1697 list of the contents of John Moore's collection of manuscripts, but the presence of annotations
                                in <date cert="low" notAfter="1650" notBefore="1550">late-16th and early-17th century</date> hands in both parts
                                suggest that they may have been bound together for a longer period.</seg>
