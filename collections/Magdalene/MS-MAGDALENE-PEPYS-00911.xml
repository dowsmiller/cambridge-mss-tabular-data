                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">Cambridge, Magdalene College, MS Pepys 911 (hereafter Pepys 911) is a beautifully illustrated example of
                                a type of medieval book known as a '<hi rend="italic">sortes</hi>' manuscript, essentially a genre of medieval book
                                concerned with various aspects of what we now describe as divination, prognostication, and fortune-telling. <hi rend="italic">Sortes</hi> manuscripts seem to have been quite a popular genre of medieval book, and among those
                                that were made in medieval north-western Europe the majority of the surviving <hi rend="italic">sortes</hi>
                                manuscripts contain various combinations of a core group of texts attributed (spuriously) to illustrious Classical
                                figures such as Pythagoras and Cicero.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The various <hi rend="italic">sortes</hi> texts popular in medieval north-western Europe follow a similar
                                pattern for use. They typically begin with a list of questions, for example: Should the reader get married? Will a
                                pregnant woman give birth to a boy or a girl? Or will a missing item be found? The reader is then guided into choosing
                                a random number (typically between 1-10) by throwing dice or turning a wheel or another specified method. That number
                                directs the reader to a numbered table or list of answers. Some <hi rend="italic">sortes</hi> texts require readers to
                                chain questions together or to add up several randomly chosen numbers, but the question -&gt; random number -&gt; answer
                                format is consistent across the majority of the surviving <hi rend="italic">sortes</hi> texts. </seg>
                            <seg type="para"> The <hi rend="italic">sortes</hi> genre of texts seems to have been known in western Europe since late
                                Antiquity, but it experienced a renewed popularity north-western Europe in the 13th century through newly available
                                Latin translations of Hebrew and Arabic <hi rend="italic">sortes</hi> texts (Iafrate, 2015). The 13th-century revival
                                of interest in <hi rend="italic">sortes</hi> texts in north-western Europe is typically discussed in relation to the
                                oldest surviving example of the genre, a manuscript now at the Bodleian Library: <bibl><ref target="https://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/manuscript_317">Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Ashmole
                                        304</ref>
                                </bibl> (hereafter Ashmole 304). Ashmole 304 was copied by the writer, scribe and illustrator <name key="person_v34451801">

                                </name> a monk belonging to the Benedictine Abbey of <name key="org_v148894515"><orgName type="display">St
                                        Albans</orgName><orgName type="standard">St. Albans Abbey</orgName></name> in England. Neil Ker seems to have
                                been the first scholar to notice that Pepys 911 is closely related to Ashmole 304, since both contain copies of some
                                of the same <hi rend="italic">sortes</hi> texts and they have very similar programmes of illustration. Pepys 911 was
                                copied in England in the second half of the 13th century, and such is the similarity of the text and illustrations
                                between the two manuscripts that Charles Burnett in his study of the manuscripts containing the 'Experimentarius'
                                attributed to Bernardus Silvestris suggested that this manuscript (Burnett's MS 'B') and Ashmole 304 (Burnett's MS
                                'A') are 'sister' manuscripts copied from the same (lost) exemplar, and placed them in a 'St Albans group'. There is
                                no suggestion that Matthew Paris was either the scribe or the artist of Pepys 911, and although both manuscripts
                                contain a shared core of texts, they each preserve <hi rend="italic">sortes</hi> texts not found in the other;
                                nevertheless the shared texts (and the shared organisation of those texts) and the similarity of their illustrations
                                (compare e.g., the Pythagoras portraits and the portraits of the 12 sons of Jacob in both volumes) demonstrates a
                                close relationship between the two books. </seg>
