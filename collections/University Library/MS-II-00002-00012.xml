                                          <seg type="para">There existed in late medieval England a broad and varied culture of the use of the
                                                vernacular for the study of the Bible, beyond that associated with the Oxford theologian John
                                                Wycliffe, his followers or the Lollard movement. This manuscript illustrates one strand of that
                                                culture, being one of only two surviving copies of a Middle English commentary on the Gospel of
                                                Matthew, and the only copy to contain the text of the prologue. The other copy is found in <bibl subtype="external" type="MS">
                                                      <ref target="http://searcharchives.bl.uk/IAMS_VU2:IAMS032-001983906">London, British Library, MS
                                                            Egerton 842, ff. 1r-244v</ref>
                                                </bibl>, though there the text is in a different, and thought to be original, order. Similar
                                                commentaries on the Gospels of Mark and Luke are preserved in <bibl subtype="external" type="MS">
                                                      <ref target="https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/zq542pz5281">Cambridge, Corpus Christi
                                                            College, MS 32</ref>
                                                </bibl>. It had previously been thought that the three were related, even the work of a single author,
                                                but this has since been questioned.</seg>
                                          <seg type="para">A rubric at the opening of this manuscript points to the northerly origins of the
                                                translated commentary on Matthew: 'A man of the north country drew (i.e. translated) this in to
                                                English' (spelling modernised). Linguistic analysis of this manuscript has localised the dialect to
                                                Nottinghamshire, and that of the Egerton and Corpus manuscripts to the same region. Although this does
                                                not mean that these manuscripts originated in that specific location, nevertheless it points to a
                                                shared tradition of vernacular Biblical exegesis in the north, distinct both geographically as well as
                                                intellectually from that taking place in Oxford under Wycliffe's aegis.</seg>
                                          <seg type="para">This is reflected in the presentation of the text in these three manuscripts. In Wycliffite
                                                Glossed Gospels, passages of Bible text (translated into English) were written in a larger script, and
                                                alternated with passages of commentary (also in English) written in a smaller script. By contrast, the
                                                set of manuscripts to which MS Ii.2.12 belongs follow the pattern set by another northern biblical
                                                translation, the <title key="work_4280">English Psalter</title> of <name key="person_v2465074">
                                                      <persName type="display">Richard Rolle</persName>
                                                      <persName type="standard">Rolle, Richard, 1290?-1349</persName>
                                                </name>: a quotation from the Latin Vulgate, distinguished by the use of larger or more formal or
                                                rubricated script (or a combination thereof), is followed closely by an English translation, and then
                                                the commentary. (For comparable examples of the presentation of Rolle's text, see: <ref target="https://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/6f67de24-8947-4f34-99ed-20b0fa9e2d22">Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS.

                                          <seg type="para">Unlike Rolle's text, however, the commentaries on Matthew and Mark (and, to a much lesser
                                                extent, Luke) include marginal notes that identify the sources of their interpretations. The system is
                                                also different to that found in the Wycliffite Glossed Gospels, in which references were embedded in
                                                the columns of text. On the subject of sources, close comparative study of this small family of
                                                vernacular commentaries reveals important differences between them. Whereas the commentaries on Mark
                                                and Luke in Corpus MS 32 drew on the <title key="work_12106">Glossa ordinaria</title>, the commentary
                                                on Matthew drew on the <title key="work_4753">Catena aurea</title> of <name key="person_v264344179">
                                                      <persName type="display">Thomas Aquinas</persName>
                                                      <persName type="standard">Thomas, Aquinas, Saint, 1225?-1274</persName>
                                                </name>. Notably, this is the same source used by the Wycliffite Glossed Gospels, but of which the
                                                compilers made very different uses, the Matthew commentator melding them into a continuous text rather
                                                than a series of discontinuous glosses, and adopting a freer style of translation.</seg>
                                          <seg type="para">Furthermore, the Matthew commentator drew from a wider variety of sources than did the Mark
                                                and Luke commentator, not all of them commentaries, and produced a much longer text as a consequence.
                                                It is likely, then, that the commentary found in this manuscript and Egerton 832 was the product of an
                                                author or team of authors working independently to the person or persons responsible for the
                                                commentary in Corpus MS 32, albeit with a shared aim of bringing scholastic exegesis to new audiences
                                                through the use of the vernacular.</seg>
