                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">This manuscript, probably produced in the first half of
                                the 16th century, contains a <title>Miscellany of canon law and
                                    other texts in Greek</title>. The largest component, accounting for the
                                majority of the manuscript, is the compendium of canon law compiled
                                from earlier collections by the 14th-century monk and theologian
                                Matthaios Blastares. This collection is organised by topics arranged
                                in alphabetical order, and became a standard reference work across
                                the Orthodox Christian world. The other content includes a variety
                                of briefer canon law texts, particularly relating to penance and
                                marriage, and excerpts from collections of civil law. The manuscript
                                also contains a wide range of other texts including including lists
                                of ecclesiastical offices, short chronicles and chronological lists,
                                miscellaneous religious texts, a brief Hebrew-Greek lexicon and
                                other linguistic lists.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The manuscript was copied by many different hands, but
                                is probably the product of a single project of production. The hand
                                responsible for the largest proportion of the text appears at a
                                number of points through the manuscript, and is identified by a
                                colophon on <locus from="194r" to="194r">f. 194r</locus> as the
                                priest Theodosios Martinos.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">There is evidence from water staining that the
                                manuscript has been divided into at least two parts in the past, but
                                the combination of hands and the watermarks in the paper suggest
                                that this division does not result from the two parts having been
                                produced separately but from later detachment. The manuscript was
                                rebound in the early 17th century, using manuscript waste to form
                                limp boards, within a leather cover.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The manuscript evidently spent time subsequently in
                                southern Greece in the early modern period, as a note on <locus from="1r" to="1r">f. 1r</locus> records its ownership by the
                                hieromonachos (priest and monk) Nikephoros Pringelis, a native of
                                Athens, while other notes mention the Metropolitan of Sparta and the
                                ordination by the Metropolitan of Nauplion of a priest for
                                Argos.</seg>

                                        has been torn away, and the lower outer corner of <locus from="170r" to="171v">ff. 170-171</locus> have been cut
                                        away, presumably following earlier damage. Large paper
                                        patches were previously attached to substitute for these
                                        losses, removed in <date calendar="gregorian" when="2019">2019</date> and now housed separately. There is wear
                                        and tear to the edges of some folios, which has been been
                                        repaired with Japanese paper. Tears to ff. <locus from="83r" to="83v">83</locus>, <locus from="98r" to="100v">98-100</locus> have been repaired with earlier paper
                                        patches. Some folios have become partially detached in the
                                        gutter. A single wormhole appears in the first few folios

                                        contributed to softening of the paper. Probably in part due
                                        to the weakening of the paper as a result of this, tears and

                                    century</origDate>, as indicated by the combination of
                                watermarks and the style of script. The significant water damage to
                                the folios leading up to <locus from="176r" to="176v">f. 176</locus>
                                and the lack of similar damage to those from <locus from="180r" to="180v">f. 180</locus> onwards could suggest that <locus from="180r" to="203v">ff. 180-203</locus> are of a different
                                origin from the earlier part of the manuscript. However, the
                                commonality of hands and date of the papers suggests that this was
                                all originally one manuscript, but that the later quires at some
                                point became detached from the rest, which then suffered water
                                damage, before it was rebound and the detached quires
                                reattached.</origin>
