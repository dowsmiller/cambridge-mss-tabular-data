                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">This manuscript, copied in England and
                                completed in 1632, is the second part of a four-volume
                                copy of the <title>Panoplia Dogmatike of Niketas Choniates</title>. The author was a high official of the Byzantine
                                government in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, best known for
                                his history of his own time, which includes the principal Byzantine
                                account of the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204.
                                Following this disaster, Choniates took refuge in <placeName key="place_g6004242">Nicaea</placeName>, seat of an emerging
                                Byzantine government in exile, but failed to regain steady
                                employment in imperial service. It was there that he completed this
                                text, a vast theological compilation, which includes allusions to
                                the straitened circumstances in which he now lived.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The main purpose of the work was the refutation of
                                heresies and other religions, including paganism, Judaism, Islam, and
                                non-Orthodox strands of Christianity from antiquity to the present.
                                Among these is the western, Catholic Church, whose emerging schism with
                                the Orthodox Church had both contributed to and been inflamed by the
                                outcome of the Fourth Crusade. Drawing heavily on existing texts,
                                the work's most original sections concern various theological
                                controversies that had occurred within 12th-century Byzantium. The
                                early chapters were closely based on the similar work of the monk
                                Euthymios Zigabenos, composed a century earlier.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">This copy was produced by the clergyman Thomas Bayly or
                                Bailey, as part of his project to produce an edition and Latin
                                translation of the text. The first five of its 27 books had
                                previously been translated into Latin by Pierre Moreau, but it
                                otherwise remained unavailable in print. Bayly's undertaking was
                                never completed, but extensive evidence of his approach is present
                                in his marginal annotations to the four volumes and a variety of
                                associated papers which have been preserved alongside them. Although
                                presently bound in four volumes, and referred to as such in Bayly's
                                papers, the original pagination of the manuscripts is in two
                                sequences, one covering the first and second volumes and the other
                                the third and fourth. This suggests that they had perhaps been
                                produced as a two-volume set originally but soon rebound as four
                                when this proved unwieldy.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Besides Moreau's publication, Bayly's only access to
                                the work of Choniates itself was the single Bodleian Library
                                manuscript which served as the exemplar for this copy, but he aimed
                                to improve and expand upon the text by collating it with the texts
                                of works on which Choniates had drawn. These included works of the
                                Fathers of the Church which Bayly consulted through their printed
                                editions, and the work of Euthymios Zigabenos, consulted via a
                                manuscript copy in Trinity College, Cambridge. The four volumes are
                                extensively annotated with proposed emendations from these sources,
                                and Bayly also envisaged incorporating additional passages from
                                Zigabenos which Choniates had omitted in his adaptation of the
                                earlier work. Copies of some of these passages survive among the
                                associated papers, along with notes regarding the planned
                                translation and other texts which may have been intended to
                                supplement the edition. There are also two sections of Latin
                                translation, one a brief excerpt, while the other, longer section
                                comprises the early part of Book 6 of the text. Since Moreau's
                                translation had extended to the end of Book 5, this presumably
                                represents the beginning of Bayly's main work of translation, and
                                may well be as far as he ever got with the task.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Like Choniates, Bayly's life was afflicted by warfare
                                infused with religious controversy. A committed Royalist with
                                Catholic sympathies, during the English Civil War he served in the
                                defence of Raglan Castle in 1646, despite his clerical vocation. He
                                also published tracts regarding the king's religious opinions and
                                discussions with his own patron, the Catholic Henry Somerset,
                                Marquess of Worcester, which had occurred while all three men were
                                at Raglan. It was perhaps due to unemployment after the surrender of
                                Raglan and Worcester's imprisonment that in December 1646 Bayly sold
                                his manuscripts of Choniates to the London bookseller Cornelius Bee.
                                However, in March 1647 he was able to retrieve two of the four
                                volumes, along with a number of printed books. The circumstances are
                                unclear, but evidently the four were subsequently reunited. Bayly
                                was briefly imprisoned in 1649 after publishing writings in defence
                                of the recently executed king and against the new regime of the
                                Commonwealth, and subsequently left the country, converting openly
                                to Catholicism. The manuscripts presumably remained in England, where
                                they were acquired by another clergyman, Richard Drake, who donated
                                them to Pembroke College in 1663.</seg>
