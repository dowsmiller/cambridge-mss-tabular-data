                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">This manuscript, copied in the last quarter of the 16th
                                century, is composed mainly of <title>Greek prayers and
                                    hymns</title>. Some of these are drawn from the <hi rend="italic">Horologion</hi> (Book of Hours) known as the <hi rend="italic">Thekara</hi>, whose compiler, known by the same
                                name, is sometimes identified with the Byzantine scholar Thomas
                                Magistros (c. 1275-c. 1346). Other short texts include the eleven
                                Gospel readings of the Resurrection (<hi rend="italic">eothina</hi>), instructions on the recitation of hymns, and a brief
                                narrative in which Thekara answers a spiritual query from another
                                monk named Theodoulos.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Most of the manuscript is the work of a single scribe,
                                the monk Gregorios, who shifted between two distinct styles of
                                writing. It appears to have been produced originally as six distinct
                                physical entities, four of which are substantial and distinguished
                                by their own separate sequences of quire signatures. Two of these
                                begin with brief prayers of invocation in the margin of their first
                                folio, such as might be written by a monk beginning a new piece of
                                work (ff. <locus from="117r" to="117r">117r</locus>, <locus from="261r" to="261r">261r</locus>).</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Of the other two, smaller portions, one is a single
                                brief quire at the beginning of the manuscript, perhaps originally
                                intended as endleaves before content was copied into it by other
                                hands, including calendrical tables. The other consists of two
                                quires at the end, of which the last few folios were left blank by
                                Gregorios, perhaps for the same purpose, but were filled in with
                                additional hymns, attributed to the 9th-century hymnographer Joseph,
                                by another hand.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">It therefore seems that Gregorios did not originally
                                envisage the different portions becoming part of a single volume.
                                However, whereas he wrote no colophon at the end of any of the four
                                substantial portions of the manuscript, he did add one at the end of
                                his work in the last, which amounted to the copying of a mere twelve
                                folios. This suggests that when he came to produce this, the
                                decision had already been taken to bind all of the parts together
                                into a single manuscript, and that this brief portion was intended
                                as a supplement to the larger body of content to which it was
                                added.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The manuscript long retained an early modern Greek
                                binding which may well date from its original production, but due to
                                deterioration and damage to the spine, it has been rebound. The
                                components of the old binding are housed alongside it.</seg>

                                <p>The former binding, of Greek origin and probably original to the
                                    production of the manuscript, has been retained and is housed
                                    with the manuscript.</p>
                                <p>There are four sewing stations prepared with v-notches. The
                                    sewing is an unsupported loop-stitch with an S-twist sewing
                                    thread.</p>
                                <p>Greek-style endbands around two cord cores. The primary endbands
                                    are made of wound cream threads around one core. The secondary
                                    decorative endband creates a chevron pattern on top of the
                                    primary and over a thinner upper core. Yellow and red threads
                                    have been used to create the decorative chevron. A yellow and
                                    blue loop is visible on the headband towards the left board.
                                    This loop probably marks the previous location of a page marker
                                    now lost.</p>
                                <p>One transverse continuous plain textile lining covering up to one
                                    third of the boards.</p>
                                <p>Board attachment is bridling, each station including three holes.
                                    The three holes create a v-shape configuration. The thread
                                    passes from the spine edge to the inner side of the board. The
                                    cover obstructs the study of the outer face of the board;
                                    however it can be assumed that the thread travels from the inner
                                    side of the board to the outer side and then back inside.</p>
                                <p>Hardwood wooden boards with horizontal grain. The boards have no
                                    grooved edges but are shaped at the spine edge both inside and
                                    outside of the board. The inside of the board creates a gentle
                                    curve to the spine; the outside edge of the board is rounded.
                                    Full covering of dark brown tanned skin with butt-mitred
                                    turn-ins.</p>
                                <p>Both boards have the text of prayers written on the inside, in a
                                    late 16th or 17-century hand.</p>
                                <p>There are four holes on the corners of both boards suggesting
                                    previous use of furniture. There is a peg on the foredge of the
                                    left board towards the bottom corner, and a hole in the upper
                                    foredge suggesting the presence of another peg now lost. There
                                    are two pairs of holes through the right board near the foredge,
                                    matching the peg location. There are remnants of a braided
                                    leather strap on the inner face of the right board on the bottom
                                    pair of holes.</p>
                                <p>Blind tooling decoration, with a similar pattern for both boards.
                                    Outer single-fillet border with two double-fillet frames
                                    enclosed. Three circles at each corner of the two inner frames.
                                    A single tool forming two hearts facing is repeated between the
                                    second and the third frame, creating a decorative roll. A single
                                    floral tool is used at the corners of the inner frame.</p>
                                <p>The classmark is printed on two modern paper labels stuck at the
                                    head and tail of the spine.</p>

                                    (e.g. ff. <locus from="153v" to="153v">153v</locus>, <locus from="188r" to="188r">188r</locus>, <locus from="212v" to="213r">212v-213r</locus>).</p>
                                <p>On <locus from="3v" to="3v">f. 3v</locus> is a note in Greek in
                                    an 18th or 19th-century hand, referring to a monastery of the
                                    Taxiarches in Zagora: <q xml:lang="grc">Ἐσφερετίσθε παρ

                                <p>The main body of the manuscript, <locus from="5r" to="320v">ff.
                                        5r-320v</locus> was copied by <name role="scr" type="person">
                                        <persName type="display">the monk Gregorios</persName>
                                        <persName type="standard">Gregorios, monk</persName>
                                    </name>, as indicated by his colophon on <locus from="320v" to="320vc">f. 320v</locus>, probably in the <origDate calendar="gregorian" notAfter="1599" notBefore="1575">last
                                        quarter of the 16th century</origDate>, as indicated by the
                                    combination of watermarks. This would be consistent with the
                                    style of script.</p>
                                <p>The manuscript contains four successive sequences of quire
                                    signatures, while no items of content run across more than one
                                    such sequence and the same type of paper is shared only between
                                    the first two. This indicates that these portions were
                                    originally produced as separate entities. The last two quires,
                                    which lack signatures or the crosses marked at the beginning of
                                    most of the other quires, whose content is similarly distinct
                                    and which were written in a different ink from the preceding
                                    quires, probably constitute another such entity. Two portions
                                    also begin with prayers of invocation in the margin, suggesting
                                    the beginning of a new piece of work (ff. <locus from="117r" to="117r">117r</locus> and <locus from="261r" to="261r">261r</locus>). However, the fact that all of the four
                                    sections with signatures, and the first quire and part of the
                                    second quire at the end of the manuscript, were copied by the
                                    same scribe in the same format, and that he wrote a single
                                    colophon at the end of the last and briefest of the sections he
                                    copied, suggests that they were combined into a single volume at
                                    an early date. The presence of the colophon suggests that they
                                    were intended for this purpose before they left the scribe's
                                    possession.</p>
                                <p>The first quire (<locus from="1r" to="4v">ff. 1-4</locus>),
                                    shorter than the rest, not included in the first quire sequence,
                                    partly blank, and copied by different hands in a style
                                    suggesting a similar date to the work of Gregorios, was probably
                                    originally intended as endleaves. The last three folios of the
                                    last quire (<locus from="321r" to="323v">ff. 321-323</locus>),
                                    following the colophon and copied by another hand of similar
                                    date, may have been originally left blank and intended for a
                                    similar purpose, before having additional content added at some
                                    point after the manuscript's completion.</p>
