                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">This Gospel lectionary manuscript was probably copied
                                in the 12th century, although it has been suggested that it is a
                                product of the 13th century or later, produced in deliberate
                                imitation of the style of an earlier period. The inclusion of a
                                feast particular to the liturgical calendar of Constantinople
                                    (<locus from="39v" to="39v">f. 39v</locus>) may indicate that it
                                was produced in the Byzantine capital, though it could merely
                                reflect the reproduction of a feature of the exemplar from which it
                                was copied. Its elegant and somewhat unconventional minuscule script
                                is unusually large, a feature probably related to its similarly
                                unusual content, which is much more limited than that of a
                                conventional lectionary and differently arranged.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">In the usual arrangement of a lectionary, the early
                                part of the book contains the <hi rend="italic">synaxarion</hi>, the
                                readings of the movable calendar beginning from Easter, followed by
                                the <hi rend="italic">menologion</hi>, containing the lections of
                                the fixed calendar beginning from 1 September, sometimes followed by
                                miscellaneous readings. While the selection of lections in the <hi rend="italic">menologion</hi> varies greatly between different
                                manuscripts, the <hi rend="italic">synaxarion</hi> normally falls
                                into one of two standard varieties. The "weekday" type, typically
                                for monastic use, includes lections for the whole week, except in
                                Lent, when the New Testament was read only on Saturdays and Sundays,
                                while the "Saturday-Sunday" type generally used in other churches
                                contains only the lections for those two days, except in Holy Week
                                and the period between Easter and Pentecost, when weekday lections
                                are also included. In this manuscript, however, not only is the
                                range of feasts included in the <hi rend="italic">menologion</hi>
                                very small, but only a handful of the most important days in the
                                movable calendar appear. The order is also unconventional, since the
                                readings of the <hi rend="italic">synaxarion</hi> for Lent which are
                                included appear after the <hi rend="italic">menologion</hi> rather
                                than preceding it. Given the focus on major festivals, it is likely
                                that at least some of the lections of Holy Week would have followed,
                                but much of the later part of the manuscript is missing, including
                                its end.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The size of the script implies a superfluity of funds,
                                since it constitutes an inefficient use of expensive parchment.
                                Other manuscripts of this rare type include exceptionally opulent
                                examples such as <ref target="http://www.csntm.org/Manuscript/View/GA_Lect_117">Florence, Biblioteca Medicea Laurentiana, MS Med. Palat.
                                    244</ref>, whose text is gilded throughout. A degree of
                                conspicuous consumption is also suggested by the very existence of
                                such a book, whose content was completely inadequate for the
                                day-to-day needs of a church, and implies that an institution
                                already possessing a lectionary sufficient for its needs acquired an
                                additional one for special occasions. However, the availability of
                                funds may not have remained consistent throughout the project. The
                                use of gold for headings, ubiquitous in the early folios,
                                subsequently becomes more restricted and then disappears entirely,
                                though reappearing towards the end. Gold does, however, remain in
                                use throughout for the ornamented initial letters of each lection
                                and other decoration.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The opening folios are, most unusually, written
                                entirely in red ink, usually reserved for headings, before abruptly
                                switching to the more usual brown, in the transition from recto to
                                verso of the same folio (<locus from="3r" to="3v">f. 3r-3v</locus>).
                                The accompanying ekphonetic musical notation, which guided the
                                chanting of the text and was normally written in red, appears
                                instead in blue on the pages written in red, before reverting to its
                                more normal colour at the same time as the text. Since text for
                                gilding was usually written in red ink before being covered with
                                gold, this could imply that this lectionary was at first intended as
                                a truly deluxe production like the Laurentiana manuscript, but that
                                this ambition was curtailed at an early stage, before the further
                                reductions in the use of gold already mentioned. However, the use of
                                blue ekphonetic notation suggests that the initial intention was for
                                the main text to remain red, calling for the use of a different
                                colour to keep the notation clearly distinct. The early abandonment
                                of the initial scheme may nonetheless reflect a reduction in
                                resources, but from a somewhat more modest starting point.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Three of the lections are accompanied by later notes in
                                Arabic to identify them. This indicates that the manuscript spent
                                part of its history in use by an Arabic-speaking Christian community
                                in the Middle East, whose members retained Greek as their liturgical
                                language but did not understand it well, and would thereore find
                                such annotations helpful in finding the right text. One of these
                                annotations, however, in fact identifies the lection incorrectly.
                                Its provenance remains somewhat mysterious, since it was brought to
                                Britain in the early 20th century by a man who then died without
                                revealing where he had acquired it. Ellis Minns, the Librarian of
                                Pembroke College who subsequently purchased it, reported that the
                                sand and variety of dead insects which he found between the leaves
                                led him to suppose that it had spent time in a desert
                                monastery.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">By this time, as well as losing many of its folios and
                                suffering severely from water damage, the manuscript had lost its
                                last binding, and it remains unbound apart from its damaged endbands
                                and small remnants of its sewing. It is presently protected by a
                                loose leather wrapper which was clearly once the covering material
                                of a book, and whose appearance would be consistent with the kind of
                                provenance suggested by Minns. However, this cover was evidently not
                                that of the manuscript's own former binding, since its structure
                                implies that the book for which it was made had a different sewing
                                arrangement.</seg>

                                <condition>There have been extensive losses in the gutter to many
                                    folios, sometimes causing loss of text, which have been repaired
                                    with paper patches, creating some hinging on some folios and
                                    restricting the opening of others. There is a tear in the gutter
                                    to <locus from="38r" to="38v">f. 38</locus> and tears to the

                                    repaired with paper patches. Numerous worm-holes and other small
                                    holes are present in the outer folios (ff. <locus from="1r" to="6v">1-6</locus>, <locus from="83r" to="88v">83-88</locus>). There is significant creasing, sometimes
                                    obscuring text, and the edges of the folios are brittle, with a
                                    worn area on the tail-edge. There is extensive and serious water
                                    damage, especially in the gutter, which has led to some blurring
                                    of the text, and there is abrasion of the ink in
                                    places.</condition>

                                <p>The manuscript has lost its boards and most of its sewing, of
                                    which only small fragments remain, and for which there were four
                                    sewing-stations. Both endbands survive in part, sewn with bright
                                    red thread around a round core and through a blue textile.
                                    Traces of paint indicate that the edges were once painted red.
                                    The text block is wrapped in a loose leather cover with
                                    turn-ins, decorated on both faces with a simple border and
                                    diagonal lines using fillets. There are ridges on the spine for
                                    three stations of a supported sewing as well as for the
                                    endbands, the position of which does not correspond to that of
                                    the sewing-stations or endbands of the text block. There is no

                    <history>
                        <origin>The manuscript was probably copied in the <origDate calendar="gregorian" notAfter="1200" notBefore="1100">12th
                                century</origDate>, as suggested by Easterling (p. 188). It has been
                            variously dated in the past, Minns favouring a date in the 11th or 12th
                            century, while reporting that Robert Devreesse argued that it was an
                            archaising product of the 13th century or later, imitating the style of
                            the 11th century, owing to features such as the downward extension of
                            some letters (Minns, pp. 215-217). However, the occasional presence of
                            angular breathings in a text usually employing round ones seems more
                            consistent with a 12th-century date than with either the faithful
                            imitation of 11th-century practice or the inadvertant retention of
                            13th-century or later norms, although their presence in 13th-century
                            manuscripts is not unknown. The considerable variation in the size of
                            letters and the range of transitional forms of mute <hi rend="italic">iota</hi> present also seem to rule out either a genuine
                            11th-century production or an effective imitation of one. Devreesse,
                            Giovanni Mercati and a Dr Gianelli, in correspondence reported by Minns,
                            suggested that it was produced in the <placeName key="place_g7234911">Aegean islands</placeName>, while Minns argued for production in
                                <placeName key="place_g7002473">Constantinople</placeName> (Minns,
                            pp. 215-217), on the basis of its similarity to the lavish <ref target="http://www.csntm.org/Manuscript/View/GA_Lect_117">Florence,
                                Biblioteca Medicea Laurentiana, MS Med. Palat. 244</ref> and the
                            distinctive reference to the Chalkoprateia in the lection heading for 1
                            September (<locus from="39v" to="39v">f. 39v</locus>). The feast this
                            alludes to was particular to Constantinople, though it does not
                            necessarily indicate production in the capital, since it could have been
                            simply reproduced from the manuscript's exemplar.</origin>

                            191 in Barnard's Catalogue for 1924). Minns reports that Barnard had
                            acquired it from another firm, following the death of an unnamed man who
                            brought it to Britain from an unknown source. The presence of Arabic
                            notes suggests that it had spent time in <placeName key="place_g7016833">Egypt</placeName> or <placeName key="place_g7001519">the

                            been housed in a desert location (Minns, pp. 217-218).</provenance>
