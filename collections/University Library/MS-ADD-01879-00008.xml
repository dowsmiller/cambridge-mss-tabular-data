                     <seg type="para">This fragment is a wooden board which previously
                                formed part of the binding of a book. Pieces of waste parchment have
                                been attached to the surface, apparently to strengthen its
                                structural integrity after the wood cracked. Additional pieces,
                                reused from old manuscripts seem to have been affixed for a similar
                                purpose but since lost. The ink on these pieces left a residue on
                                the wood and on the surviving parchment, leaving mirror-image traces
                                of Greek text in a number of different hands, both majuscule and
                                minuscule, orientated both vertically and horizontally. The board
                                also retains fragments of sewing and endband thread, textile spine
                                lining and leather covering material.</seg>

                                <p>A single board of a medieval or early modern binding from the
                                    eastern Mediterranean. The grain of the wood runs parallel from
                                    head to tail. The edges of the board are square with the
                                    exception of the spine edge, which has a peripheral cushion.</p>
                                <p>Sewing thread once used as a board attachment remains. The sewing
                                    thread passes between eight sewing attachment holes in four
                                    pairs. From the head edge these pairs are measured at 46mm,
                                    89mm, 175mm, 211mm. The sewing thread passes between the holes
                                    in an S-pattern on the inside of the board from head to tail.
                                    Recesses are cut for the thread to pass between each pair but
                                    not for the diagonal thread. One end of the sewing thread can be
                                    seen at the uppermost pair of sewing attachment holes. There is
                                    one hole just below the uppermost pair of sewing attachment
                                    holes which contains thread remnants, though its use is
                                    unclear.</p>
                                <p>A pair of anchor holes at head and tail exist to accommodate the
                                    endband sewing tie downs. They are no further than 25mm from the
                                    spine edge of the board and no further than 20mm from the head-
                                    or tail-edge. Three endband threads remain, very similar to the
                                    sewing thread, passing through the endbanding holes closest to
                                    the spine edge and three through the next, at both head and
                                    tail. Recesses are cut for the endband threads to pass on the
                                    outside face of the board only.</p>
                                <p>Two groups of three holes, in a triangular pattern, exist towards
                                    the fore-edge of the board, these holes possibly indicate the
                                    presence of straps at one point. It is unclear whether the three
                                    holes are a set or a pair and a single.</p>
                                <p>Remnants of a textile spine lining exist, passing over the spine
                                    edge of the board and extending onto the outer face.</p>
                                <p>Patches of parchment, and possibly tawed skin (seen on the outer
                                    face of the board but obscured by a later parchment sheet on the
                                    inner face) have been used to repair a split in the board, which
                                    can be detected at the head edge. A sheet of parchment, almost
                                    the size of the board, is adhered to the inner face of the
                                    board, probably once again to stabilise splits in the board.</p>
                                <p>Remnants of previous leather coverings exist, at the outer face
                                    towards the spine edge of the board and as turn-ins at the head
                                    and tail on the inner face of the board. </p>

                        <origin>The board was used in the binding of a book in the eastern
                            Mediterranean at some point before the <origDate calendar="gregorian" notAfter="1868">mid-19th century</origDate>. The text visible on it
                            was appaerntly written on various manuscript leaves which were
                            subsequently reused as waste, being adhered to the board and leaving a
                            residue of their ink on it.</origin>
