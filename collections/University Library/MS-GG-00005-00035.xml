                            <seg type="para">Copied by perhaps four scribes during the mid-11th century, this manuscript contains a wide variety of
                                classical, late antique and early medieval poetic texts. Alongside works by such authors as Juvencus, Sedulius,
                                Arator, Boethius, Rabanus Maurus and Aldhelm, the manuscript also preserves a variety of other kinds of text,
                                including several prayers transliterated from Greek, prose medical texts, and riddles and hymns. One part (ff. <locus from="432r" to="443v">432r-443v</locus>) perhaps more than any other has been the focus of scholarly attention
                                over the last century and a half: a collection of forty-five works, most of them poems, and some set to music, which
                                has prompted the application to this manuscript of the epithets 'Carmina Cantabrigiensia', 'Cambridger Lieder' and the
                                'Cambridge Songs'.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Contrary to these denominations, the manuscript had no medieval connection with its present home; rather,
                                a 13th-century ownership inscription and pressmark (f. <locus from="iii verso" to="iii verso">iii verso</locus>) prove
                                that it belonged to the Benedictine Abbey of St Augustine, Canterbury, where it was almost certainly produced and
                                where it remained through the fifteenth century and until the abbey's dissolution in 1538. The presence of German and
                                macaronic German-Latin poems in this section - including six in praise of Frankish emperors Henry II (973-1024),
                                Conrad II (c. 990-1039) and Henry III (1017-1056), as well as others that mention archbishops Heriger of Mainz (d.
                                927), Heribert of Cologne (d. 1021) and Poppo of Trier (d. 1047), among other material - indicate that these contents
                                derived from a continental, probably German exemplar. The mention in one of these works of the death of Conrad II
                                means that the production of this portion of the manuscript must have post-dated 1039. The manuscript thus bears
                                witness to the continuation to the very cusp of the Norman Conquest of a cultural and intellectual exchange between
                                Anglo-Saxon England and the German lands - an exchange truncated by subsequent political events and the development of
                                much closer ties between English monasteries and foundations in northern France.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Various theories have been advanced to explain the rationale behind the production of this manuscript,
                                its compilation and the arrangement of the texts it contains (see <bibl>Ziolkowski (1994)</bibl>, pp. xx-xxv for full
                                details). A suggestion that the 'Songs' part had belonged to a peripatetic poet-musician and were only bound later
                                into the manuscript was disproven by the material evidence: the texts are not confined to one quire but extend into
                                another, and moreover were copied by the same scribe responsible for many other parts of the rest of the manuscript.
                                That these contents are unlikely to have derived from such an exemplar is indicated by the narrow subject-matter -
                                references to various emperors, and to four nuns in a specific German convent, for example - that would have been
                                unlikely to appeal to foreign audiences; moreover, some of the songs were intended for performance not by a single
                                person but by multiple voices, including a pair of choirs. Others have argued that the songs may have been compiled as
                                a manual of instruction for such an aspiring performer, but whether that role was ever performed by or in the context
                                of a monastic institution has not yet been demonstrated.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">That the manuscript represents a compilation of a wide variety of (often incomplete) poetic works has
                                lent weight to the proposal that it was a florilegium, a gathering of many different literary genres, topics and
                                themes from a variety of sources and exemplars, by an enthusiast for both ancient and contemporary poetry. The
                                glossing of some of these texts with neumes - a form of medieval music notation - has further prompted others to argue
                                that it was their musical rather than literary characteristics that inspired their compilation. Adopting a broader
                                scope, seeking to understand the contents of the manuscript as a whole, A.G. Rigg and Gernot Wieland in 1975 proposed
                                instead that the manuscript originally comprised three 'classbooks', to which the 'Songs' component was soon after
                                appended: the compilation of poetic works were "graded according to difficulty", in order to fulfil a distinct
                                pedagogical purpose, and therefore offer "a remarkable insight into educational practice in the late Anglo-Saxon
                                period". Plentiful interlinear and marginal glosses provided additional instruction or clarified the meaning of the
                                texts they accompanied, with the songs added "either because of their interest as a lyric collection" or because they
                                had been copied by the same hand as other parts of the manuscript. Alternatively, the manuscript may have been made
                                not as a book for teaching in the classroom, but for reference use as a convenient compilation of a wide variety of
                                poetic texts.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Though the manuscript was seen at Canterbury by John Leland shortly before the abbey's dissolution, its
                                provenance thereafter is unknown, as are the precise stages by which it reached the University Library. There is
                                evidence, however, to suggest that it did not stray far from its original home. It was purchased in 1672 using funds
                                raised from the sale of duplicate books bequeathed to the Library by John Hacket (d. 1670), bishop of Coventry and
                                Lichfield. Four other such purchases contain evidence of former ownership by the scholar Meric Casaubon (d. 1671), who
                                had lived and died in Canterbury. Three others whose purchase was funded by the Hacket sales had belonged to another
                                Canterbury resident, Sampson Kennard (d. 1635), and four others are also of Canterbury provenance.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The manuscript is now no longer complete, nor was it when the book was foliated by the 15th-century
                                librarian of St Augustine's, Clement Canterbury. For example, in quire 45, Clement's numbering indicates the presence
                                of two leaves between those he numbered <locus from="441r" to="441r">*441</locus> and <locus from="442r" to="442r">*444</locus>. However, at the time of his numbering, neither of these leaves can have been conjoint with another
                                in the second half of the quire, where Clement's numbering runs without interruption from <locus from="445r" to="445r">*453</locus> to <locus from="446r" to="446r">*454</locus>, indicating that these two leaves had already been lost
                                by that time. Further portions have been lost since then, including at the end of the manuscript a quire or quires
                                containing a text entitled 'Oraciones ciceronis' in the 12th-century contents list on f. <locus from="iii verso" to="iii verso">iii verso</locus>, and found on 'ffo. *455 usque in finem' according to Clement's annotation.
                                Between the end of Quire 27 and the beginning of Quire 33, a discrepancy occurs in the contemporary quire signatures:
                                    <locus from="269v" to="269v">Quire 27</locus> is numbered 'XXVII' but <locus from="329v" to="329v">Quire
                                    33</locus> is 'XXXIIII' (no quire signatures are visible on the intervening leaves). This may simply reflect an
                                error in numbering; however, taken with the loss of the three final leaves from Quire 28 (after f. <locus from="276v" to="276v">276</locus>), it is possible that a whole quire is missing from the manuscript between Quires 28 and 29.
                                The loss of the three leaves from Quire 28 must post-date Clement's foliation: its last leaf, was numbered *277 by him
                                - and the next leaf, the first of the next quire, *281. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">A further loss occurred in more recent times. In March 1981, Margaret Gibson encountered a leaf during a
                                search for manuscripts containing texts of Boethius, at the Stadt- und Universitätsbibliothek in Frankfurt-am-Main,
                                where it was known as Fragm. lat. I 56. A collaboration between Prof. Gibson, Christopher Page and Michael Lapidge
                                subsequently confirmed its identification as a missing leaf from the present manuscript (see Gibson et al., 'Neumed
                                Boethian <hi rend="italic">metra</hi>' (1983) for a full account).</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The much-faded Arabic numerals in the <locus from="441a recto" to="441a recto">upper right-hand
                                    corner of the recto side</locus> of this leaf prove that it was in place when the volume was foliated by Clement
                                Canterbury during the 15th century. The leaf was still bound with the rest of the manuscript in 1839, when it was
                                examined by Georg Pertz. By 1896, however, it had gone missing, since Robert Priebsch noted the absence from the
                                manuscript of the Boethian <hi rend="italic">metra</hi> described by Pertz over half a century earlier. Alerted to the
                                possibility that the leaf might have been alienated from a manuscript in Cambridge, investigations were undertaken by
                                Dr Gerhardt Powitz, Leiter der Handschriftenabteilung at Frankfurt. The leaf, along with fragments from other
                                manuscripts, had been bequeathed to Frankfurt by the scholar Theodor Oehler (1810-43). From correspondence preserved
                                at Frankfurt, Oehler is known to have visited Cambridge in 1840 and doubtless examined the manuscript at that time.
                                The structure of Quire 45 and the sequence of Clement Canterbury's folio numbers prove that the leaf conjoint with
                                this one had been missing since the 15th century. It is likely, then, that this leaf was already loose, possibly even
                                detached, by the time Oehler came to Cambridge.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Papers kept in the running file for MS Gg.5.35 in the Department of Rare Books and Early Manuscripts at
                                the University Library relate the return of the leaf. On 2 September 1982, Dr Klaus-Dieter Lehmann, Director of the
                                Stadt- und Universitätsbibliothek Frankfurt, wrote to Mr F.W. Ratcliffe, then University Librarian, to offer to return
                                the fragment to its rightful owners. Noting Pertz's recording of the contents of the leaf in 1839 and the fact that
                                'the fragment appears among the papers of Theodor Oehler only shortly thereafter', Dr Lehmann concluded that 'one can
                                assume that he did not come by it legally'. On 15 November that year, Arthur Owen, Senior Under-Librarian and Head of
                                Manuscripts, wrote to Powitz confirm the safe arrival of the leaf in Cambridge. 'My first action on opening the parcel
                                was to compare the leaf with our manuscript Gg.5.35, and to confirm beyond any doubt that they belong together,' Owen
                                wrote. 'We are deeply grateful to Dr Lehmann and to yourself for your generous action in returning this leaf to the
                                manuscript from which it was removed.'</seg>
                            <seg type="para">In his letter to Powitz, Owen stated, 'We shall now arrange for the leaf to be bound into the manuscript
                                so as to prevent any future mishap of a similar kind.' This did not occur, however, and for forty years between its
                                return in 1982 and 2022 the leaf remained separate from the rest of the manuscript. It was housed for the latter part
                                (or perhaps all) of this period in a separate melinex folder, within the same box as the rest of the manuscript. Images 
                                of the leaf in this state were previously displayed at the end of the sequence on the Cambridge Digital Library, 
                                in order to reflect the leaf's storage as a physically discrete item.
                                The inclusion of the manuscript in the
                                Wellcome-funded project, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/curious-medieval-medicine">Curious 
                                    Cures in Cambridge Libraries</ref></hi>, afforded
                                the opportunity to release the leaf from its melinex folder and rebind it in its correct place in
                                the manuscript, which work was completed in late 2022 by Marina Kruger-Pelissari, Project Conservator.
                                The leaf was then photographed again, in its proper place in the manuscript, by Raffaella Losito, Project Photographer.
                                The reunion of the leaf with the rest of the volume is now reflected in the updated description and 
                                display on the Cambridge Digital Library.</seg>

                            <seg type="para">The prospect of recovering the music of lost songs of the distant past is tantalising, even more so when
                                traces survive in unfamiliar notations that cannot be fully reconstructed. This is the case for much of the early
                                medieval Latin song repertory, which has long been considered lost because the notational signs employed record only
                                melodic outlines, relying on oral traditions that have now died out to supply missing details.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Research conducted by Dr Sam Barrett of the University of Cambridge, in collaboration with the Medieval
                                Ensemble Sequentia, has enabled the reconstruction of part of this repertoire. This series of videos introduces some
                                of these reconstructed songs from Boethius' sixth-century De consolatione philosophiae (On the Consolation of
                                Philosophy), one of the most widely read books of the Middle Ages. A single source, the ‘Cambridge Songs’ Leaf, held
                                in Cambridge University Library, is taken as a focus for exploration.</seg>

                            <seg type="para">The opening video introduces the project. Six subsequent short videos allow the viewer to follow the
                                notation (neumes) in the manuscript as the melody for the opening lines of each song notated on the leaf is sung in
                                turn.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">More information about the processes of reconstruction and how to read neumes is provided on the <ref target="https://boethius.mus.cam.ac.uk/">project website</ref>.</seg>

                                <condition>The manuscript has been trimmed at previous rebindings; in places, the text and marginal glosses now run
                                    very close to the edges, though pricking marks for horizontal ruling are frequently still visible. The fore-edges
                                    of the leaves are fragile, even brittle in places, with many very small closed tears. There is water- or
                                    damp-staining to a number of the leaves. The lower part of the leaves at the fore-edge are noticeably more grimy
                                    and stained than the rest, perhaps as a consequence of frequent and heavy handling of the manuscript during its
                                    lifetime. Where the parchment has become particularly fragile, stabilisation repairs have been applied. Some of
                                    the erotic poems within the 'Cambridge Songs' section of the manuscript have been erased through scraping and
                                    attempts to restore the text in some of these locations during the nineteenth century through the application of
                                    chemical reagent have left dark brown stains (for example, ff. <locus from="438v" to="439r">438v-439r</locus>,
