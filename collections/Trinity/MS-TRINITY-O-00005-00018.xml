                  <summary>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">This manuscript, copied in London in 1634, contains a
                                series of <title>Greek antirrhetical texts</title>, including catalogues
                                of heresies, treatises refuting particular doctrines, excerpts from
                                the decrees of Ecumenical Councils and procedures for receiving
                                former heretics and converts from other religions into the
                                Church.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">Most of the contents were copied by a deacon of
                                Macedonian origin named Leontios Vyssios. They were selected from a
                                manuscript which had been acquired a few years earlier, in <date calendar="gregorian" instant="false" when="1629">1629</date>, by the London
                                theological institution Sion College, which is now <bibl default="false" status="draft" subtype="external" type="MS">London, Lambeth Palace Library, MS Sion
                                    L40.2/G6</bibl>. The latter is a composite manuscript assembled
                                from parts of a number of earlier books, whose contents, besides
                                those copied here, included chronographical, catechetical and legal
                                texts. Evidently the patron responsible for the copying of this
                                manuscript was interested only in the content relating to doctrinal
                                disputes and conversion.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">Within less than two decades of its creation, this
                                manuscript was in the possession of the scholar and royal librarian
                                Patrick Young, who extensively annotated it, including collating the
                                longest text with two other manuscripts. This work was the
                                compendious work on heresies compiled by John of Damascus, which
                                combined earlier texts on the subject, principally that of
                                Epiphanios of Constantia, and added some original material. The
                                component texts appear here under separate headings. The copies with
                                which this one was collated were a manuscript belonging to James
                                Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh, now in Trinity College, Dublin, and
                                another from the Barocci collection of the Bodleian Library. Young
                                also added a small amount of content which he copied himself from
                                Ussher's manuscript, and a series of lists of heresies gleaned from
                                a variety of different antirrhetical texts. The early date at which
                                he was using the manuscript and his intensive engagement with its
                                contents suggests that Young may have been the patron who arranged
                                for it to be copied.</seg>

                                    This numbering was evidently added to supply the lack of
                                    original foliation on <locus from="71v-[72r]" to="[93v]-94r">ff.

                                    pagination. When the original foliation resumed, this was
                                    apparently considered erroneous and therefore struck through and
                                    replaced or overwritten. The overwriting of the earlier folio
                                    numbers on <locus from="[81v]-82r" to="[81v]-82r">ff.

                                    numbers are usually absent, perhaps caused some confusion,
                                    leading to the error whereby the number 94 has been placed where
                                    one would expect 95 and 95 where one would expect 97, leaving
                                    the page numbers thereafter too small by two.</foliation>
