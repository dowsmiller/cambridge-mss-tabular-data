                            <!--Introduction by Daniel Wakelin-->

                            <seg type="para"><hi rend="bold">A note on the display of images:</hi></seg>
                            <seg type="para">In several places in the manuscript, a single sheet document has been folded in two and placed around the
                                outside of a quire. Some may have functioned as protective wrappers while those quires circulated separately, prior to
                                their binding between covers with the rest of the manuscript. When bound into the manuscript, one half of such a
                                document appears before the first leaf of the quire, and the other after the last leaf of the quire. When the
                                manuscript came into the possession of Matthew Parker, the leaves were paginated in the characteristic red/orange
                                crayon, with only odd numbers appearing on the recto side of each leaf. Since each half of these documents formed a
                                leaf in the manuscript, these too were paginated in the same sequence, as follows: <list>
                                    <item>pp. 1-2 + 3-4 [not enclosing other leaves]</item>
                                    <item>pp. 39-40 + 41-42 [not enclosing other leaves]</item>
                                    <item>pp. 77-78 + 79-80 [not enclosing other leaves]</item>
                                    <item>pp. 235-236 + 257-258 [enclosing pp. 237-256]</item>
                                    <item>pp. 243-244 + 249-250 [enclosing pp. 245-248]</item>
                                    <item>pp. 299-300 + 311-312 [encloding pp. 301-310]</item>
                                    <item>pp. 313-314 + 323-324 [enclosing pp. 315-322]</item>
                                </list></seg>
                            <seg type="para">When the manuscript was rebound in 1952, all but the last of these folded sheets was released, in order
                                that the text they bore could be read. The fourth, fifth and six of those listed above were placed before the
                                beginning of the quire they had previously enclosed. For reasons that are not clear, the seventh was never released,
                                but remained bound in around pp. 315-322. The manuscript was disbound between 2005 and 2009, in preparation for its
                                digitisation, and these bifolia were photographed as separate leaves and fully opened so that their text could be read
                                across a single image. Once again, the seventh folded document was not given this treatment, and was photographed only
                                as two separate leaves. As of 2012, the manuscript has been rebound in a limp parchment binding, matching the 1953
                                rearrangement but also releasing the seventh folded document and placing it before the leaves it formerly enclosed.
                                This binding and its accompanying endleaves are recorded in this description but have not been digitised. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The display of the images on the Parker Library on the Web is intended to show the manuscript's leaves in
                                their sequence prior to the 1953 rearrangement and rebinding, but also to show the full text of these folded sheets
                                once they have been opened up. The sequence the images follow is: the recto and then the verso of the first half of
                                the folded sheet is shown, followed by the full opening, the rectos and versos of the enclosed leaves, and finally the
                                recto and verso of the second half of the folded sheet. The presentation of pp. 39-40 + 41-42 is more complicated,
                                because the sheet was folded in such a way that its text ran around the back of the sheet (not around the inside), and
                                because the beginning of the text falls on the last page (p. 42) and its end on the first page (p. 39). As explained
                                above, the one exception is the seventh sheet, which was not photographed fully opened across pp. 314 and 323. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">For the Cambridge Digital Library, it has been decided instead to show the images in the sequence that
                                they now appear in the manuscript. The sequence the images follow is: the recto and then the verso of the first half
                                of the folded sheet is shown, followed by the full opening, the recto and then the verso of the second half of the
                                folded sheet, and then the rectos and versos of the leaves they enclosed. The pagination still follows that written in
                                red/orange crayon, and where an opening is shown both page numbers are given: for example, pp. 42-39, or pp. 78-79.
                                The textual contents of these folded leaves will be described only where the sheet is shown fully opened. Since the
                                seventh folded sheet has been released, images of pp. 314 and 323 are adjacent to one another, and occur before the
                                images of the leaves they formerly enclosed (pp. 315-322). </seg>

                                                give a sense of the manuscript's tall and narrow shape. The dimensions of the other parts are ignored
                                                here because they concern inserted leaves that typically have been bound in vertically and their
                                                original height and width have been cropped to match the dimensions of the manuscript's core part.</p>

                                    <p>The leaves that contain pages 30a-30b, 294a-294b, and 304a-304b are fragmentary and have been restored to their
                                        original sizes with blank paper in modern times. The leaf that contains pages 330a-330b is a stub with a few
                                        scribles or notes written on it. The leaves were not paginated by Matthew Parker: a modern hand has written
                                        numbers with 'a' and 'b' supplements in pencil in the upper outer corners of both sides of these leaves. There
                                        is also one fragmentary leaf restored with blank paper that may have been paginated by Parker. This concerns
                                        the manuscript's final leaf to which a modern hand has added the numbers '333' and '334' in pencil to the
                                        upper outer corners of both sides of the leaf.</p>

                                        refer to images that show texts that run across two pages. These typically involve pre-existing documents that
                                        Worcestre inserted into this manuscript, except for pp. [78 and 79] which contains a text by Worcestre that is
                                        part of the <hi rend="italic">Itineraria</hi> and runs across two pages. These numbers have been added to the

                                        supplied.</p>
                                    <p>When the manuscript was rebound in 1953, it was decided to re-organise inserted leaves that originally were
                                        folded around the outsides of quires, and this new organisation was maintained when the manuscript was given
                                        its current binding in 2012. Consequently, Parker's pagination sequence is out of order. For a reconstruction
                                        of the manuscript's original order, see Harvey (1969), pp. 407-416 ('Conspectus of Pages').</p>

                                <p>The manuscript has a limp parchment binding [not photographed] that dates to 2012. It consists of veiny parchment
                                    that has been folded over thin paper covers laced onto an alum-tawed goatskin spine-covering featuring green
                                    headbands with six thongs of alum-tawed skin.</p>
                                <p>Current binding height: 310mm; width: 120mm; depth: 40mm.</p>
                                <p>The current binding (2012) replaces a binding that was made by the bookbinder John P. Gray of Cambridge in 1952.
                                    The latter has been preserved but is kept separately from the manuscript [not photographed]. It concerns a binding
                                    of brown leather over wooden boards with blind-tooled vertical 'teeth' on the covers that correspond with the
                                    positions of five raised bands on the spine. The latter features the gold-stamped classmark: <q>MS. 210</q> and
                                        <q>C.C.C.C.</q>. The old binding is accompanied by two old paper flyleaves at the beginning, numerous rigid
                                    paper stubs, and two old paper flyleaves at the end. The classmark <q>MS 210</q> is inscribed in ink on the first
                                    flyleaf at the beginning with a note about Gray.</p>
                                <p>Old binding height: 315mm; width: 150mm.</p>
                                <p>When the manuscript was re-bound in 1952, single documents that William Worcestre had folded around the outsides of
                                    quires were relocated so that they could be read across the fold without interuption. This modern organisation was
                                    maintained when the manuscript was bound again in 2012.</p>

                                to have used Chaucer's translation to read the original Latin passages from Boethius (book IV, metre 3 and prose 3)

                                <note><p>NB: William Worcestre has inserted six documents into this manuscript that were created as separate textual
                                        units by other scribes and has added texts that are part of the <hi rend="italic">Itineraria</hi> to them.
                                        This catalogue record treats these documents as separate parts. Parts 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 should be consulted
                                        for further items of the <q>Itineraria</q>.</p>
                                    <p>This catalogue record follows the edition of Harvey (1969) and considers a few items in Worcestre's hand as
                                        separate from the <q>Itineraria</q>.</p>

                                        of other materials that evidently were of interest to Worcestre. For example, it includes a multiplication

                                <note>Dallaway (1834) identifies the writer as Worcestre's son Richard. The letter, which mentions Thomas Kent and a
                                    letter from a male member of the Paston family, is undated but may have been written between c 1460-c. 1480.
                                    Afther the death of John Fastolf in 1459, Worcestre, Fastolf's former secretary, became much involved with John
                                    Paston, one of Fastolf's executors, concerning the distribution of his possessions.</note>
