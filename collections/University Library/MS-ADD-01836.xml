                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">This manuscript, probably produced in the late 12th or
                                13th century, is unusual in being a combined <title>New Testament
                                    lectionary</title>. It gives the readings for each day both from
                                the Gospels and from the Acts and Epistles, whereas these were
                                normally read from two separate books. The two types of lection
                                alternate in a single sequence. It is also unusual in that it gives
                                only the lections for the Sunday liturgy, with the exception of the
                                first Saturday of Lent and the Saturday of Lazarus, preceding Palm
                                Sunday. Normally lectionaries give either the lections for both
                                Saturdays and Sundays or those for the whole week.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Much of the early part of the manuscript has been lost.
                                The surviving original portion was copied by three different
                                scribes, one of whom was responsible for most of what remains. At
                                some point after it was first produced, its content was slightly
                                expanded. Two extra bifolios were inserted into one of its quires,
                                giving additional lections. These pertain to the morning service of
                                Epiphany and to the Sundays either side of the festival, and were
                                inserted on either side of the folios containing the lections for
                                the main liturgy of Epiphany itself. The scribes who copied each of
                                these bifolios and the ruling patterns used are different from one
                                another as well as from the original body of the manuscript, so
                                despite the similarity of their content, it may be that the two
                                additions were made on different occasions, whichever intervention
                                came later perhaps being inspired by the example of the earlier
                                one.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The manuscript shows signs of being a product of the
                                Greek communities of southern Italy. A substantial Greek-speaking
                                population existed in this region while it was under Byzantine rule
                                in the early Middle Ages, and although the empire was expelled from
                                    <placeName ref="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/7030363">Sicily</placeName> by the Arabs in the <date calendar="gregorian" from="0900" to="0999">10th</date> century
                                and from the mainland by the Normans in the <date calendar="gregorian" from="1000" to="1099">11th</date>, Greek
                                language and culture persisted for centuries thereafter. Worship in
                                Greek according to the Byzantine rite continued, for which
                                liturgical books continued to be produced.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">One of the characteristic features found in this
                                manuscript is the poor quality of its parchment, which displays
                                numerous holes created during the stretching and drying of the skin.
                                When making a high-grade manuscript, any sheet in which such holes
                                appeared would have been rejected, while even in more humble
                                products of the Byzantine mainstream they would usually only be used
                                if the holes were positioned where they could be kept to the
                                margins, rather than impairing the writing surface itself. In
                                peripheral regions such as southern Italy standards were often
                                lower, leading to the appearance of manuscripts such as this one, in
                                which the text is frequently interrupted by holes in the material,
                                appearing right in the midst of the written area. That these are
                                original to the process of production, rather than the product of
                                later damage, is clearly visible from the fact that none of the text
                                has been lost to them. Instead it skips over them, with the
                                beginning of a word often appearing on one side of a hole and the
                                remainder on the other side. Even where no hole has opened up, flaws
                                in the parchment have led to areas of the written surface being left
                                bare, which can account for a large proportion of the folio (<locus from="130v" to="130v">f. 130v</locus>).</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The work of one of the original scribes displays
                                deficiencies in the use of breathings, which are always of the
                                smooth type, even where the word requires a rough breathing (e.g.
                                    <locus from="51r" to="53v">51r-53v, line 5</locus> ). The
                                copyists of one of the inserted bifolios (<locus from="163* recto" to="163** recto">ff. 163* recto-163** recto</locus>) follow the
                                same practice, and make other widespread errors, often omitting
                                breathings altogether, wrongly including them or placing them over
                                the wrong letter, sometimes in ways which are not merely incidental
                                slips but are consistently applied. The copyist of the other
                                inserted bifolio (<locus from="166* recto" to="166** verso">ff. 166*
                                    recto-166** verso</locus>) largely omits breathings altogether.
                                This haphazard grasp of orthography shows deficiencies in the
                                scribes' training which seem consistent with an origin in a region
                                such as southern Italy, somewhat detached from the mainstream of
                                Greek-speaking culture.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Another feature suggestive of an origin in southern
                                Italy is the use of translucent yellow wash to highlight various
                                pieces of information on lections. Such highlighting is a
                                characteristic south Italian feature, though one that is also found
                                in manuscripts from neighbouring Epiros in western Greece.</seg>

                            <origin>The main body of the manuscript was probably copied in the
                                    <origDate calendar="gregorian" notAfter="1299" notBefore="1180">late 12th or 13th century</origDate>, as suggested by the style
                                of script. The poor quality of parchment, the use of highlighting in
                                yellow wash and the poor scribal standards reflected in the use of
                                diacritics suggest an origin in a peripheral region, most probably
                                    <placeName key="place_g4005365">southern Italy</placeName>.
                                Features such as the continued use of angular breathings by one of
                                the hands, the lack of mid-line syllabic abbreviations and
                                superscript word endings, and the lack of letter-forms such as the
                                modern <hi rend="italic">eta</hi> and modern <hi rend="italic">nu</hi> tend in favour of an earlier date. However, the small
                                majuscule <hi rend="italic">kappa</hi> is not normally found before
                                the late 12th century, and a peripheral origin makes more likely the
                                retention of practices which had largely ceased in the Byzantine
                                mainstream.</origin>
