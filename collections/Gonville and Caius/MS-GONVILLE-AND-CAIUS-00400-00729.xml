                            <seg type="para">Most of this 13th-century manuscript comprises a copy of the Latin translation of the Greek medical text,
                                    <hi rend="italic">Theraupetica</hi>, which was written by Alexander of Tralles perhaps around the second quarter
                                or middle of the 6th century. The identity of the translator or translators is not known, nor the period in which it
                                was produced, though it must have been before the turn of the 8th-9th century, the date of the earliest surviving
                                manuscript copy (now <bibl subtype="external" type="MS"><ref target="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b60004321">Paris, Bibliotheque nationale de France, MS lat. 9332</ref></bibl>). It has been suggested that the
                                translation was made shortly after the composition of the Greek original, in Ravenna or Rome, which were important
                                centres in the production of medical literature. As D.R. Langslow (2006) has pointed out, firmer conclusions could be
                                drawn if it were possible to establish 'close linguistic links' between the Latin version of the <hi rend="italic">Theraupetica</hi> and the Latin translation of Oribasius's medical works, which is now widely accepted to have
                                been produced in Ravenna - but further work remains to be done.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Alexander's medical analysis and advice is organised according to human body, in head-to-toe order. The
                                Latin text is divided into three sections, dealing first with ailments of the head, from hair-loss to issues with the
                                face and teeth, then problems of the lungs, coughing and diseases of the liver and gout, and finally fevers in
                                general. The two versions are broadly similar and of similar length overall, however there are some differences
                                between the Greek original and the Latin translation, arising from both the addition of new material and the omission
                                of some parts of the Greek text. </seg>

                                <p> Folio 1, a fragment, was probably once used as a pastedown in an older binding, although it seems to have been
                                    displaced from its earlier codicological position. There are four sets of three sewing holes along the present
                                    inner edge of f. 1, two small semi-rectangular patches of abrasion and damage along its outer edge, and there is
