                                          <seg type="para">This manuscript, probably copied in the
                                                12th century, contains two works of <title>John
                                                  Klimakos, the Ladder of Divine Ascent and To the
                                                  Pastor</title>. The author was a monk of the
                                                  <placeName key="place_g110013">Monastery of St
                                                  Catherine on Mount Sinai</placeName> in the
                                                6th-7th centuries, who became a hermit and then
                                                served as abbot in his later years. His traditional
                                                name, meaning John "of the Ladder", is confected
                                                from the title of his principal work. The <hi rend="italic">Ladder</hi> is a guide to the
                                                ascetic life, organised in thirty chapters presented
                                                metaphorically as steps on a ladder and each
                                                concerning particular virtues to be developed or
                                                vices to be overcome. It became one of the most
                                                influential works of spiritual guidance in Orthodox
                                                Christianity. The shorter work that follows it
                                                contains further advice, perhaps produced as a
                                                supplement to the <hi rend="italic">Ladder</hi>. The
                                                texts are accompanied by marginal scholia, and
                                                followed by further scholia presented as continuous
                                                text, which are drawn from the 7th-century Life of
                                                the Saint by one Daniel, a monk of the monastery of
                                                Rhaithu on the Sinai Peninsula.</seg>
                                          <seg type="para">The manuscript was written on parchment
                                                of noticeably poor quality, containing many holes
                                                created by stretching in the process of making the
                                                parchment, many of which infringe on the written
                                                area. In mainstream Byzantine book production at
                                                this date such leaves would usually have been
                                                rejected, which may indicate that the manuscript was
                                                created in a peripheral area of the Greek-speaking
                                                world. The script, however, is elegant and
                                                ornate.</seg>
                                          <seg type="para">The early quires of the manuscript have
                                                been lost. A sequence of quire signatures probably
                                                dating to its original production begins on the
                                                second surviving quire with the number 12,
                                                indicating that there were originally a further ten
                                                quires. This corresponds well with the proportion of
                                                the <hi rend="italic">Ladder</hi> which is missing.
                                                A second sequence of signatures survives from a
                                                subsequent rebinding, beginning on the second quire
                                                with the number 8. This indicates that at the time
                                                of this rebinding only six quires had been lost, and
                                                hence that the mutilation of the manuscript did not
                                                occur all at once.</seg>
                                          <seg type="para">The foliation of the manuscript follows
                                                former Cambridge University Library practice of
                                                marking folio numbers which were believed to
                                                represent the original form of the manuscript,
                                                omitting numbers corresponding to missing folios.
                                                The calculation of this sequence erroneously took
                                                the later signature sequence as its basis,
                                                conjecturing the loss of only six quires in total
                                                rather than ten. The manuscript's current classmark
                                                appears not only on the first surviving folio
                                                  (<locus from="50r" to="50r">f. 50r</locus>), but
                                                also on the first folio of the second quire (<locus from="57r" to="57r">f. 57r</locus>). This suggests
                                                that the mark was added before the book's most
                                                recent rebinding and at that time this was its first
                                                folio, implying that the current first quire was
                                                previously detached or bound out of order.</seg>
