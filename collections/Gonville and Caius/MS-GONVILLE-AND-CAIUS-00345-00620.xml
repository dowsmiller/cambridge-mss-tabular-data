                            <seg type="para"> This manuscript is a composite volume comprised of five Parts, a larger first Part, and four, smaller,
                                mostly single-quire Parts at the end of the volume. The first four Parts all contain medical treatises in Latin; the
                                final Part is a fragment of a psalter. </seg>

                                </name>, a doctor and physician to Edward IV who wrote his name on f. <locus from="[ii] verso" to="[ii] verso">[ii]
                                    verso</locus>. In common with numerous other manuscripts, Marchall added a table of contents to the beginning of
                                the manuscript (f. <locus from="[ii] verso" to="[ii] verso">[ii] verso</locus>). Marchall's ownership or use of
                                manuscripts is very well-attested, with forty-four surviving books (including this one) bearing evidence to connect
                                him to them in some way; six others may have been his or accessed by him, and a further twelve are recorded but not
                                traced. Marchall is known to have gathered together and (re-)arranged manuscripts and the out-of-sequence foliation
                                points to this manuscript being another example of this activity. </seg>
                            <seg type="para"> As described by Linda Voigts, the present manuscript is one of eighteen (possibly nineteen) manuscripts
                                at Gonville and Caius College that may be linked to Marchall, and which were probably donated by him to Gonville Hall
                                (as Gonville and Caius then was); King's College and Peterhouse, where the study of medicine was also supported,
                                received gifts of books from him too. Thirteen manuscripts owned or used by Marchall (and another with possible
                                Marchall connections) have been digitised, catalogued and conserved as part of the <ref
