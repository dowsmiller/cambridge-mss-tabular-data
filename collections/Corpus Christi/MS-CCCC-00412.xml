                                as part of the donation of printed books and manuscripts made in 1574 by <name key="person_v49234661" type="dnr">
                                    <persName type="display">Matthew Parker (1504-1575)</persName>
                                    <persName type="standard">Parker, Matthew, 1504-1575</persName></name>, archbishop of Canterbury. The core part of
                                CCCC MS 412 comprises 77 leaves (ff. <locus from="1r" to="77v">1r-77v</locus>) of instructional Latin literature.
                                Folios <locus from="1r" to="77r">1r-77r</locus> bear a copy of an anonymous text sometimes attributed to Durand de
                                Champagne known as <hi rend="italic">De informatione principum</hi>. This is followed on ff. <locus from="77r"
                                    to="77v">77r-77v</locus> by a short extract from pseudo-Augustine's <hi rend="italic">De duodecim abusionum
                                    gradibus</hi> known as <hi rend="italic">De XII abusiuis saeculi</hi>. CCCC MS 412 is a composite volume and it is
                                possible that folios <locus from="i recto" to="iv verso">i-iv</locus> and <locus from="v recto" to="viii verso"
                                    >v-viii</locus> were already bound with folios 1-77 at the time of Parker's gift to Corpus Christi College, since
                                a partially erased medieval signiature with a distinctive flourish on f. <locus from="viii recto" to="viii recto">viii
                                    recto</locus> also appears in simplified form on f. <locus from="77v" to="77v">77v</locus>. However, the signator
                                is unidentified and undated and so this may reflect a change to the structure of the volume that postdates Parker's
                                donation. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The first four medieval endleaves in the volume (ff. <locus from="i recto" to="iv verso">i-iv</locus>)
                                contain the <hi rend="italic">Articuli Cleri</hi> enacted in 1316, followed by some brief legal notes on f. <locus
                                    from="iv verso" to="iv verso">iv verso</locus>; both were copied in the same hand and the legal notes are signed
                                by an Edmund Poplay, who mentioned a connection to an unspecified university ('studia quindecim annorum que habuit in
                                hac uniuersitate in facultate arcium') and recorded the date of a legal action as <date when="1489-06-12">12 June
                                    1489</date> ('Hec gracia concessa et confirmata est anno domini millesimo cccc<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>
                                lxxxxix mensia Jun. xii<hi rend="superscript">mo</hi>'). The biographical information that Poplay recorded in his
                                notes on f. <locus from="iv verso" to="iv verso">iv verso</locus> allows him to be identified as the Edmund Poplay
                                (Popley) of the Diocese of York, who was ordained as a deacon in 1484 and was Principal of Beef Hall in Oxford c.
                                1496-1497. There is no codicological evidence for or against the union of Parts 1 and 2 in 1489 (Poplay's notes in
                                Part 1 and <hi rend="italic">De informatione principum</hi> in Part 2), so it is not possible to determine if Poplay
                                was the owner of ff. <locus from="1r" to="77v">1r-77v</locus>, or if their composite arrangement occured later. </seg>

                                    spine (not photographed); spine is unlabelled and undecorated. Paper pastedowns pasted over the turn ins. Several
                                    other manuscripts at Corpus Christi College are bound in this style and with these materials, e.g.,  <ref

                                    it is likely that the College undertook a rebinding programme in the 18th century, perhaps focussing on the most
                                    fragile or poorly bound items in the manuscript collection at that time.</p>

                            <p>The first four medieval endleaves in the volume (ff. <locus from="i recto" to="iv verso">i-iv</locus>) are in Popley's
                                hand and contain a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Articuli Cleri</hi> enacted in 1316 (ff. <locus from="ii recto"
                                    to="iv verso">ii recto - iv verso</locus>), followed by some brief legal notes (f. <locus from="iv verso"
                                    to="iv verso">iv verso</locus>). Popley signed the notes on f. <locus from="iv verso" to="iv verso">iv

                                Principal of Beef Hall in Oxford c. 1496-1497. There is no codicological evidence for or against the union of Parts 1

                                so it is not possible to determine if Poplay was the owner of ff. <locus from="1r" to="77v">1r-77v</locus>, or if
                                their composite arrangement occured later, but Poplay's ownership of ff. <locus from="1r" to="77v">1r-77v</locus>
                                offers the simplest explanation for how his notes came to be with the main section of MS 412. </p>

                                    based on palaeographical and textual information. Date of production can probably be assigned to '1499' based on a

                                    made in 1499. </note>
