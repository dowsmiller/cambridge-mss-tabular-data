                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">By around 1424, seventy-four books were recorded as belonging to the University Library. Of these, four
                                are known to survive. The manuscript shown here is one of them - and it has been part of the collection ever since
                                that time. The list of books in which it can be identified is preserved in the Cambridge University Archives as <ref target="https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-UA-COLLECT-ADMIN-00004/47">UA, Collect. Admin. 4</ref> (the list is on
                                ff. 19r-37r). The manuscript is the first of two copies of Boethius's <hi rend="italic">De consolatione
                                    philosophiae</hi> recorded as being in the Library, and it is noted as containing the text in Latin and in
                                English, with a commentary by Guillelmus de Aragonia and an index ('in latino et Anglico cum exposicione Willelmi
                                medici et cum tabula'). Definitive proof of the match is provided by the <hi rend="italic">dicta probatoria</hi>: that
                                is, the words that the register noted as being at the beginning of the second leaf of the text ('querimoniam') and at
                                the beginning of the penultimate leaf of text ('modis omnibus'), both of which correspond to what is found in this
                                manuscript. The list of books was entitled 'A register of books brought to the common library of the University of
                                Cambridge by various benefactors': pains were therefore taken by its compilers to record the identity of these donors,
                                presumably in order that their good works could be commemorated in future and emulated by others. Thanks to this, we
                                know that this manuscript was given to the Library by John Croucher/Crowcher (d. 1453), fellow of Gonville Hall, and
                                later dean of Chichester Cathedral 1426-47. Space was left in the register to accommodate the addition of further
                                entries, with 39 more books being noted by six continuators over the following sixteen or so years. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">At its core, the manuscript contains a copy of <hi rend="italic">De consolatione philosophiae</hi>, which
                                was written between 523 and 526 by Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius (d. 526). At that time, Boethius was imprisoned
                                awaiting trial and ultimately execution for treason, following a spectacular fall from the professional prominence and
                                aristocratic privilege that he had enjoyed under the patronage of the Ostrogothic king, Theodoric the Great. It takes
                                the form of a dialogue between Boethius and Lady Philosophy, the chapters switching between 'prosa'/prose and
                                'metrica'/verse, as its author confronts his change in fortune, debates the relative merits of poetry and philosophy
                                in reconciling oneself to an unjust world, and questions the source of true happiness. The Latin text is accompanied
                                by a Middle English translation, which was composed by Geoffrey Chaucer at an unknown date, but perhaps during the
                                1370s or early 1380s. This copy of the translation is one of nine surviving manuscripts (plus one fragment), and it is
                                unique in presenting the translation in parallel with the original. Chaucer's authorship is not explicitly
                                acknowledged in this manuscript, though it is elsewhere, and there is little doubt that the attribution is genuine.
                                His translation was based on a 'vulgate' version of Boethius's text - a textual tradition that emerged in the later
                                middle ages and which was separate to the original version - but was mediated through Jean de Meun's French
                                translation, and drew on a wider scholarly tradition, in particular a commentary by Nicholas Trevet and glosses
                                associated with Remigius of Auxerre.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">In this manuscript, the text of <hi rend="italic">De consolatione philosophiae</hi> alternates with its
                                translation, and the two are further distinguished by the mise-en-page: the Latin is written in a large textura script
                                on alternate lines that allowed for interlinear glosses, while the Middle English is written in a semi-formal cursive
                                script, Anglicana formata, and single spaced; the beginning of a new chapter or its translation are signalled by a
                                decorative initial, and running headers in the upper margin provide the number of the book and chapter found on that
                                opening. The text and translation are preceded by an alphabetical subject index, and followed by a detailed Latin
                                commentary by Guillelmus of Aragonia, in which different scripts were used (albeit with less consistency) in order to
                                distinguish between quotations from Boethius and Guillelmus's explanations. The manuscript is thus set up purposely
                                for study, providing numerous different entry points for its readers, the means for ready-reference and selective
                                reading, as well as support in understanding the meaning of Boethius's text - and, as such, was an eminently suitable
                                donation to the Library.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Besides shedding light on the manuscript's provenance, the 'registrum librorum' is also helpful for our
                                understanding of the form in which the manuscript arrived at the Library. Evidently, it contained not only the core
                                text and translation of Boethius, but also the alphabetical index and the commentary of Guillelmus de Aragonia: so,
                                these were not later additions, and must have been made at some point before the register was compiled around 1424.
                                Although the production of each of these appears to have taken place around the same time during the early 15th
                                century, and although the contents have a clear intellectual coherence, the codicological evidence points to them each
                                having been made separately from one another. The parchment used for the index is dark and somewhat coarser than what
                                follows. The area covered by writing differs across the manuscript (even allowing for the different number of columns
                                in each Part). The scribal hand found in the index is different to those in the Parts containing Boethius's text or
                                Guillelmus's commentary; furthermore, this latter part was copied by at least two scribes, with marked variations in
                                script choice and execution between ff. 3:2r and 3:90v, as well as an obvious change at that juncture. Leaf signatures
                                in the quires for Boethius's text are not visible and may have been trimmed away, but it is notable that there are
                                some in the quires for Guillelmus's commentary and that they begin afresh there. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">Manuscripts are dynamic objects, subject to additions, losses or other changes during the course of their
                                lives, and it may not be possible in this instance (as in many others) to determine the precise order or intention
                                behind their production. It may be that these three Parts were made separately and only brought together later; that
                                one was made and then others commissioned with the wish that they be bound with the first; or that all three were made
                                in order to go together, but simply by different craftsmen and to slightly different designs. Unfortunately, this
                                sense of fluidity or contingency is muddled by decisions made regarding foliation practices at Cambridge University
                                Library. Henry Bradshaw (1831-1886), University Librarian 1867-86, was a pioneering scholar of medieval manuscripts
                                and was instrumental in developing a means of expressing the structure of a manuscript's leaves in an alphanumerical
                                form, known nowadays as the 'collation formula' (see Collation, below). Bradshaw went further with the University
                                Library's own manuscripts, however, basing his numbering of their leaves - their foliation - on his interpretation of
                                their collation: he assigned numbers to leaves that he judged to be missing (here, the first leaf of Part 3), and also
                                restarted numbering sequences where he judged that a part of manuscript had been produced separately. In this
                                manuscript, however, he used one sequence of numbers for both the index and the text/translation, despite them being
                                of different production, and restarted the numbering at the beginning of the commentary. In order to balance the need
                                to preserve the existing foliation with the need to differentiate two identical sequences in a digital environment,
                                and in order to differentiate between sections apparently produced discretely from one another, the description
                                provided here separates the index, the text and the commentary into three Parts, retains Bradshaw's foliation
                                throughout, but adds a prefatory number to indicate which Part a particular folio is in: so, 1:1r is the first leaf of
                                the index; 2:9r is the first leaf of the text; and 3:2r is the first leaf of the commentary.</seg>

                                    <p>A hierarchy of scripts was employed in order to differentiate between quotations from Boethius (typically also
                                        underlined in red) and the commentary across much of the text in this Part. However, the choice of scripts
                                        varies, and there is considerable fluctuation in the formality with which they are executed. Folios <locus from="3:2r" to="3:8v">3:2r-3:8v</locus> comprise <term type="script">textura quadrata</term> for
                                        quotations and commentary, the latter executed in a smaller module, but drifting in places into <term type="script">Anglicana formata</term> before returning to the more formal textura. Folio <locus from="3:9r" to="3:9r">3:9r</locus> begins similarly, however the commentary again drifts into <term type="script">Anglicana formata</term> and the quotations likewise stray from strict textura, with the use
                                        of Anglicana letter-forms such as long r. Later, from around f. <locus from="3:21r" to="3:21r">3:21r</locus>
                                        onwards, the commentary becomes increasingly cursive, and although the script remains at heart <term type="script">Anglicana</term> the influence of <term type="script">Secretary</term> letter forms and the
                                        thick-thin contrast in pen-strokes becomes more apparent. From f. <locus from="3:39r" to="3:39r">3:39r</locus>
                                        onwards, the quotations themselves become fully cursive, too, with <term type="script">Anglicana
                                            formata</term> adopted, before reverting to <term type="script">textura</term> from f. <locus from="3:44r" to="3:44r">3:44r</locus>. Similar fluctuations between set and cursive scripts continue until f. <locus from="3:90v" to="3:90v">3:90v</locus>, whereupon there is a definite change in scribal hand, halfway down
                                        the first column of text. Quotations are at first written in <term type="script">Anglicana formata</term>, but
                                        this is abandoned in short order, with both quotations and commentary written for the remainder in <term type="script">Secretary</term> script. </p>
