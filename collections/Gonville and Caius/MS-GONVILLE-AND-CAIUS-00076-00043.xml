                  <summary>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">This manuscript is a composite of multiple short parts, variously
                produced in the second half of the 15th and first three quarters of the 16th
                century, whose content consists chiefly of <title>Greek medical texts</title>, but
                also includes a commentary on the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> by the ancient
                Greek scholar Didymus Chalcenterus, who worked in Rome in the time of Augustus, a
                brief text on the orations of Demosthenes by the 4th-century CE writer Libanios, and
                a short section of the 6th-century <hi rend="italic">De aedificiis</hi> of Procopius
                of Caesarea, on the buildings constructed by order of the Emperor Justinian I.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">The longest of the medical works is a text on urine by the leading
                Byzantine medical writer Ioannes Zacharias Aktouarios, whose biography is uncertain
                but who apparently worked in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. This text is
                credited with an unusual degree of originality and breadth in its use of sources
                from outside the Greek tradition, which became the definitive work on its subject
                and remained so for several centuries. There are a number of other short works, some
                of which are by the great ancient physicians Hippocrates and Galen, while others are
                anonymous.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">The manuscript is made up of ten distinct physical components,
                written on different types of paper by as many as nine different copyists, many of
                which at least were clearly produced in different contexts, as their watermarks
                indicate that their production was spread across a range from the middle of the 15th
                to the middle of the 16th century. Two of these hands have been identified with
                known Greek scribes who both worked in north-eastern Italy: one Nikolaos, who is
                known to have worked in Venice and Padua at the end of the 15th and beginning of the
                16th century, and Konstantinos Mesobotes, found in Venice, Padua and Bologna during
                the first half of the 16th.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">While most of the texts here appear in only one physical component of
                the manuscript, that of Ioannes Aktouarios spans two, the beginning appearing in the
                section copied by Nikolaos (<locus from="35r" to="66v">ff. 35r-66v</locus>) and the
                second in the following section, copied by Mesobotes (<locus from="67r" to="141r">ff. 67r-141r</locus>). However, despite the fact that these scribes worked in the
                same region during overlapping periods, it is clear that these sections were not
                produced as part of a single project, nor was one produced to complete the other,
                since there is a large overlap between the portions of the text they contain. The
                watermarks also indicate that the latter portion was produced a considerable time
                after the former. These therefore appear to be simply fragments of two original
                manuscripts produced in unrelated contexts and bound together. This section by
                Mesobotes also contains other medical texts, while a later component of the
                manuscript, containing the work of Procopius, is also in his hand (<locus from="176r" to="185r">ff. 176r-185r</locus>). Gamillscheg and Harlfinger state
                  (<hi rend="italic">Repetorium der Griechischen Kopisten 800-1600</hi>, I, 224)
                that another section (<locus from="1r" to="4v">ff. 1r-4v</locus>, containing the
                text of Libanios) was also the work of Mesobotes, but the script does not appear
                very close to other examples of his work, and the likely dating of the watermarks is
                earlier than his known period of activity.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">At some point not long after the completion of the latest portions,
                the components of these manuscripts were acquired by John Caius (1510-1573), the
                English physician and second founder of Gonville and Caius College. He evidently
                either acquired them as one entity or had them bound together, since a note in his
                hand survives recording his donation of the manuscript to the college (<locus from="[iii] verso" to="[iii] verso">f. [iii] verso</locus>). This is one of a
                number of Greek manuscripts of wholly or partially medical content acquired by Caius
                from Italy.</seg>

                  cropping. On <locus from="67r" to="67r">f. 67r</locus> a number in this position
                  has survived in full but been struck through, while the same number is written
