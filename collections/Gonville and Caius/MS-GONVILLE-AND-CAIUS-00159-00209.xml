                                Libraries project was once owned or used by <name key="person_v295191079" role="fmo">

                                </name>. The manuscript is a composite volume, comprised of several smaller Parts, and one larger Part, a late-13th or
                                early-14th century copy of Lanfranc of Milan's <hi rend="italic">Chirurgia maior</hi> which occupies roughly three
                                quarters of the volume (pp. <locus from="111" to="444">111-444</locus>). The other texts in the volume that accompany
                                the <hi rend="italic">Chirurgia maior</hi> are, for the most part, short popular medical treatises, and include the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Practica medicinae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Regula urinarum</hi> of Bartholomaeus
                                Salernitatus, the <hi rend="italic">Practica breuis</hi> attributed to (?Iohannes) Platearius, and, somewhat
                                incongruously, copies of several letters and grants by various bishops of Durham and popes all relating to the
                                foundation and management of hospitals in and around Durham in the north east of England. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">There are several pieces of evidence that indicate that the copy of the <hi rend="italic">Chirurgia
                                    maior</hi> was once a discrete and separately-bound codex before it was bound with the rest of the material in
                                what is now Gonville and Caius MS 159/209. In the first place, pp. <locus from="111" to="444">111-444</locus> have
                                their own separate foliation sequence in red ink, beginning with '.fo.<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> p.<hi
                                    rend="superscript">m</hi> ('folium primum', i.e., 'first leaf') on p. <locus from="111" to="111">111</locus>, and
                                continuing all the way to what is now p. <locus from="445" to="445">445</locus> which is marked 'fo. 168'. In
                                addition, the quires in this Part have their own discrete signature sequence in ink on the first recto of each quire,
                                beginning with quire 'a' on p. <locus from="111" to="111">111</locus> and continuing through to quire 'Q' on p. <locus
                                    from="431" to="431">431</locus>.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">All of the Parts of the manuscript must have been together by 1477 at the latest, as Roger Marchall (d.
                                1477), a former owner of the volume and perhaps the person responsible for its composite arrangement, added a table of
                                contents to the volume on p. <locus from="ii" to="ii">ii</locus> which includes entries for texts in all of the Parts.
                                Marchall added a table of contents to several other manuscripts that he owned and used, and there is evidence that he
                                may have been responsible for the creation of several of the composite volumes in his collection. The nature of the
                                composite Parts included in this volume is of interest for the study of the production and use of books in 15th
                                century England. While the text of the <hi rend="italic">Chirurgia maior</hi> seems to have been complete when it was
                                selected for inclusion in the newly-planned composite volume, some of the other texts seem to have been acephalous
                                and/or atelous at the time of their selection, and these acephalous and atelous texts were subsequently repaired by a
                                'correcting scribe'. A plausible explanation for these correcting stints is that the 'correcting scribe' worked at the
                                direction of Roger Marchall, who commisioned the 'correcting scribe' to make good these imperfect texts intended for
                                his new composite volume by copying the missing sections of text from other exemplars. The 'correcting scribe'
                                supplied the missing end (pp. <locus from="17" to="43">17-43</locus>) of the <hi rend="italic">Practica medicinae</hi>
                                of Bartholomew of Salerno, the oldest atelous Part of which is just eight leaves (pp. <locus from="1" to="16"
                                    >1-16</locus>) and breaks off mid-sentence. The 'correcting scribe' prepared new quires and continued the text on
                                p. <locus from="17" to="17">17</locus> by picking up the text exactly from the abrupt and imperfect end on p. <locus
                                    from="16" to="16">16</locus>. In the case of the deficient copy of the <hi rend="italic">Practica breuis</hi> (pp.
                                    <locus from="51" to="90">51-90</locus>), the 'correcting scribe' improved an older acephalous and atelous core by
                                adding the beginning of the text to p. <locus from="51" to="51">51</locus>, and he also prepared another quire to
                                supply the missing sections at the end of this text (pp. <locus from="87" to="90">87-90</locus>). The codicology and
                                scribal history of the <hi rend="italic">Practica breuis</hi> in this manuscript is particularly odd as the older
                                scribal stint begins on p. <locus from="52" to="52">52</locus>, but not quite at the beginning of that text. The first
                                few lines of text on p. <locus from="52" to="52">52</locus>, which are not the opening words of the treatise have been
                                struck through, presumably by the 'correcting scribe', but the recto of that leaf, p. <locus from="51" to="51"
                                    >51</locus>, which contains the opening portion of the <hi rend="italic">Practica breuis</hi> and was entirely
                                written by the 'correcting scribe' does not appear to be palimpsest. In addition to rectifying the textual
                                deficiencies in the <hi rend="italic">Practica breuis</hi>, the 'correcting scribe' clearly also paid close attention
                                to the contents of the extant text, and made a number of alterations to the <hi rend="italic">Practica breuis</hi>,
                                both in the margins and by scraping away parts of the main text and rewriting them. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The 'correcting scribe' also enhanced the contents of the volume by adding supplementary medical texts in
                                the spare leaves of the quires inserted to accommodate the missing portions of the <hi rend="italic">Practica
                                    medicinae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Practica breuis</hi>. After the <hi rend="italic">Practica medicinae</hi>
                                of Bartholomew of Salerno, he added another, short text by the same author, the <hi rend="italic">Regula urinarum</hi>
                                (pp. <locus from="43" to="44">43-44</locus>) and, similarly, after the <hi rend="italic">Practica breuis</hi>, he
                                added a small collection of medical recipes in Latin and Middle English. The 'correcting scribe' also added extracts
                                from the <hi rend="italic">Chirurgia parua</hi> - a text often attributed to Lanfranc of Milan - to the last leaf of
                                the last quire of the Part containing Lanfranc's <hi rend="italic">Chirurgia maior</hi>. It should be noted that none
                                of these additions is noted in Marchall's table of contents, raising the possibility that they post-dated Marchall's
                                ownership of the book or at least the insertion of the table of contents - but if so, the scribe's style of
                                handwriting suggests that it must have been close in time.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The 'correcting scribe' makes a final appearance on the last leaf of this volume (now pp. <locus
                                    from="445" to="446">445-446</locus>). The copyist of the <hi rend="italic">Chirurgia maior</hi> (pp. <locus
                                    from="111" to="443">111-443</locus>) also copied a series of extracts onto p. <locus from="444" to="444"
                                    >444</locus> from a text described in the manuscript as 'extracte de paruo compendio' - i.e., the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Chirurgia parua</hi>, an epitome-text on surgery also attributed to Lanfranc of Milan in some
                                manuscripts. On the following leaf, the 'correcting scribe' added further extracts from the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Chirurgia parua</hi>, closing his additions with a final rubric (now badly rubbed) 'Hec
                                    <unclear>extracta</unclear> sunt de paruo compendio lamfranci ad eiusdem <sic>mamdatum</sic>', which explicitly
                                ties their work to the excerpt-text that began on p. <locus from="444" to="444">444</locus>. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The only Part of the manuscript not to be emended by the 'correcting scribe' is Quire 8 (pp. <locus
                                    from="99" to="110">99-110</locus>), which contains copies of documents relating to the foundation and upkeep of
                                hospitals around the city of Durham. This quire sits between the <hi rend="italic">Practica breuis</hi> and the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Chirurgia maior</hi> in the volume's current order. The inclusion of the Durham hospital documents
                                does not appear to be a post-medieval addition to the volume, as, like all of the other quires in the volume besides
                                Quire 1, it bears a medieval quire signature that belongs in a medieval sequence that runs consecutively through the
                                volume from 'i' to 'xxiii' (pp. <locus from="18" to="18">18</locus>
                                <hi rend="italic">seq</hi>.). Taken together, the interventions of the 'correcting scribe' and the Roman numeral quire
                                signatures indicate that the current arrangement of the volume has been stable since the later middle ages.</seg>

                                that remains now is an erasure in the position where Marchall typically signed his books. Marchall's ownership or use
                                of manuscripts is very well-attested, with forty-five surviving books (including this one) bearing evidence to connect
                                him to them in some way; six others may have been his or accessed by him, and a further twelve are recorded but not
                                traced. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">For her article on Marchall's manuscripts, Voigts examined the <hi rend="italic">Registrum Vetus</hi> of
                                Peterhouse, essentially a living catalogue of the Peterhouse library holdings in the 15th century that was begun in
                                1418 (for printed versions of the <hi rend="italic">Registrum Vetus</hi> see M.R. James's <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Catalogue</hi> of the Peterhouse manuscripts and vol. 10 of the Corpus of British Medieval Library Catalogues,
                                where it is UC.48). The <hi rend="italic">Registrum Vetus</hi> includes a donation list of books in Marchall's hand
                                that Marchall intended for Peterhouse Library. Marchall's list was sewn onto one of the pages of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Registrum Vetus</hi> where it was then annotated by a Mr Roukeshawe (a fellow of Peterhouse from c. 1450 until
                                his death in 1504) who added a note at the top of the list: 'Billa magistri Rogeri Marshall de dono suo scripta
                                propria manu sua anno domini 1472' ('Magister Roger Marchall's list of his donation written by his own hand in the
                                year of the Lord 1472'). The eighth item on the donation list is described by Marchall as a 'Cirurgia lamfranci
                                [sic]'. Voigts notes that Gonville and Caius MS 159/209 'contains [a] <hi rend="italic">Cirurgia Lanfranci</hi> as
                                text 3, a physically separable section (pp. <locus from="111" to="443">111-443</locus> of a 445-page manuscript) with
                                RM title'. Voigts seems to be suggesting that what is now Gonville and Caius MS 159/209 (or perhaps just pp. <locus
                                    from="111" to="443">111-443</locus>) are a match for the book described by Marchall as his copy of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Cirurgia Lanfranci</hi> in his 1472 list of donations to Peterhouse. It is no great obstacle that
                                the description 'Cirurgia lamfranci' should signify the medieval entirety of what is now Gonville and Caius MS
                                159/209: the <hi rend="italic">Chirurgia maior</hi> is approximately three-quarters of the extant volume and so
                                referring to the volume by its most substantial text may have been sufficient means of identification. Other items in
                                the Peterhouse donation list are described by one text when their codices in fact contain several. In addition, there
                                is no evidence that all twelve of the items descibed on Marchall's 1472 list of donations to the Peterhouse library
                                actually entered the library or that they remained there permanently, despite his encouragement for the books to be
                                stored 'in vinculis' (in chains). According to Voigts, of the twelve books listed by Marchall for donation to the
                                library, three can be identified with certainty among the Peterhouse collection, six have plausible identifications
                                among the Peterhouse collection either in the current holdings or former library catalogues, and three cannot be
                                identified in the current holdings or any previous library catalogues, including one manuscript on the Peterhouse
                                list, 'Tabule Philippi Aubyn', which Voigts notes was seen by John Leland (d. 1552) at Gonville Hall and has since
                                (probably) been lost.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">It is unclear, then, when or by what means this manuscript came to Gonville and Caius, except that it
                                must have arrived by 1600, when it is recorded as no. 120 in the <hi rend="italic">Ecloga Oxonio-Cantabrigiensis</hi>
                                by Thomas James (1600). Gonville and Caius College possesses 17 (perhaps 18) other manuscripts owned by Marchall that
                                seem to have arrived at the College before his death in 1477, so it is possible then that the volume entered the
                                Gonville and Caius Library before 1477, rather than c. 1477-1600. If the 'Cirurgia lamfranci' of the Peterhouse
                                donation list is the same as pp. <locus from="111" to="443">111-443</locus> of this volume then it must have been
                                redirected between 1472, when Marchall made the list of his donation to Peterhouse, and his death in 1477.</seg>

                                <collation> This is a composite manuscript, which is comprised of one large final Part preceded by smaller Parts
                                    deriving from originally separate manuscripts. All quires apart from the first quire are numbered in ink in Roman
                                    numerals in the lower margin of their last verso in what appears to be a medieval signature sequence. This
                                    medieval sequence begins at p. <locus from="18" to="18">18</locus>, which has the designation 'i' and continues to
                                    p. <locus from="446" to="446">446</locus>, which has the designation 'xxiii'. This sequence of quire signatures is
                                    medieval and suggests that at one point, this manuscript existed without pp. <locus from="1" to="16">1-16</locus>
                                    since p. <locus from="16" to="16">16</locus> does not bear a signature from this sequence. Interestingly, Quire 2
                                    ('i' in the medieval sequence) is a single leaf, and as it bears a quire signature, it would normally be assumed
                                    that several preceding text leaves had been lost, but in this case the text proceeds without interruption from
                                    Quires 1-2 and Quires 2-3 (i.e., from the unmarked quire to Quire 'i', and Quires 'i'-'ii' according to their
                                    medieval designations). The collation of the entire manuscript is described below: <list>

                                Marchall's ownership and use of manuscripts Linda Voigts examined the <hi rend="italic">Registrum Vetus</hi> of
                                Peterhouse, which includes an added slip (now p. 22 of that book) in Marchall's hand and which records a list of
                                twelve manuscript donations to the College ('Billa magistri Rogeri Marshall de dono suo scripta propria manu sua anno
                                domini 1472' / 'Magister Roger Marchall's list of his donation written by his own hand in the year of the Lord 1472');
                                Marchall describes the 8th item on the list as the 'Cirurgia lamfranci'. Voigts then notes that this volume, i.e.,
                                Gonville and Caius MS 159/209 'contains <hi rend="italic">Cirurgia Lanfranci</hi> as text 3, a physically separable

                                that either what is now Gonville and Caius MS 159/209 pp. <locus from="111" to="446">111-446</locus> or what is now
                                Gonville and Caius MS 159/209 in its entirety is the same item referred to in Marchall's 1472 list of manuscripts for
                                donation to the Peterhouse library. There is no clear record of when or by what means MS 159/209 entered the library
                                collection of Gonville and Caius, but the present manuscript is one of eighteen (possibly nineteen) manuscripts at
                                Gonville and Caius College that may be linked to Marchall, the others of which were probably donated by him to
                                Gonville Hall (as Gonville and Caius then was) before his death. </p>

                                <note>Quire 2 is a single leaf (pp. 17-18), and it has a medieval quire signature in the lower margin of the verso
                                    which would typically indicate the loss of several preceding text-leaves, but there is no disruption to the text
                                    between either pp. <locus from="16" to="17">16-17</locus> (end of Quire 1, beginning of Quire 2) or pp. <locus

                                <note>Probably copied from an English exemplar written before c. 1250: the scribe has misunderstood a typical
                                    abbreviation for 'enim' in the exemplar (two short straight vertical lines, crossed through their centres with a
                                    longer horizontal line) and rendereded it as .n. in this manuscript in the opening words of the text; in many
                                    cases the horizontal cross-stroke on the enim-abbreviation is placed high or slightly slanted which adds to its
                                    potential to resemble a letter 'n'. </note>

                                <note>Copied by two scribes, the earlier of the two writing pp. 52-86, and the later of the two (the 'correcting
                                    scribe') writing p. 51 and correcting the text by erasing some of the older text on pp. 52-86. The earlier version
                                    of the text (i.e., the text on pp. <locus from="52" to="86">52-86</locus> was deficient at beginning and end the
                                    later scribe added the missing sections of the text. The text supplied by the 'correcting scribe' on p. <locus

                                    have been struck out so that the remaining text flows correctly between pp. 51-52. The text on p. 86 breaks off in
                                    the middle of the word 'pacientis' and the text continues in the next Part at p. 87 with '-cientis' (Recio Muñoz,
                                    63.7) by the 'correcting scribe' who completes the word. </note>
