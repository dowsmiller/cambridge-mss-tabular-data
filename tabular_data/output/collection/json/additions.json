Latin translations of Alfred's prefatory letter and the metrical preface are copied on fols 3v-4v in a 16th-century hand. A hand of similar date has added an interlinear modern English gloss to those two texts on fols 5r-7r Graham suggests that this gloss probably served as a model for the gloss accompanying the edition of the prose and metrical prefaces included in Matthew Parker's 1574 edition of Asser's life of King Alfred, Ælfredi regis res gestae (Graham 1995:633-34).Graham notes the name 'Johannes Parker' in red crayon in the top right-hand corner of fol. 5r, probably in Matthew Parker's hand (Graham 1995:636-37). He suggests that the archbishop wrote the names of his two sons in several of his volumes, probably indicating which of them should inherit it. One of his other copies of the Pastoral Care (Trinity R.5.22) is inscribed 'Matthaeus Parker'.Other 16th-century additions include the underlining of two lines in red crayon on fol. 146v and the addition of the word finis at the foot of the same page.The text on the 16th-century flyleaf, fol. 150v, and readable from the offset on fol. 151r, is a document in Latin from Richard Lyell, Doctor of Law and vicar-general to Thomas Thirlby, Bishop of Westminster concerning a matrimonial case. The document contains a date in 1543, probably the year in which it was issued. For more details see Graham 1995:632.

Shelfmarks are added on the front pastedown (253, D.β.3 and Ii-2-4) and on fol. 150r (4:2.3).Interlinear Latin glosses in pencil are added intermittently throughout in a hand (or hands) that are probably modern. In addition to adding foliation and signatures to the MS, Henry Bradshaw added notifications of missing leaves on the front pastedown and fol. 146v, and a summary of the collation on the back pastedown in the 19th century.In the course of repairs to the manuscript in 1967, two modern parchment leaves were added, fols 2bis and 151bis.","locus: locus":"92r; 30; 3v-4v; 5r-7r; 5r; 146v; 150v; 151r; front pastedown; 150r; front pastedown; 150r; front pastedown; 146v; back pastedown; 2bis; 151bis","locus: from":"92r 30r 3v 5r 5r 146v 150v 151r 1v 150r 1v 150r 1v 146v 152r 2bis_R 151bis_R","locus: to":"92r 30r 4v 7r 5r 146v 150v 151r 1v 150r 1v 150r 1v 146v 152r 2bis_V 151bis_V","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"Abraham Wheelocke (1593-1653); Wheelocke, Abraham, 1593-1653","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"","bibliography: ref(s)":"","bibliography: ref URI(s)":""},{"metadata: addition UID":"_addition_1","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_1","metadata: collection":"","metadata: ms ID":"","metadata: shelfmark":"Cambridge, University Library, MS Dd.5.5","metadata: ms type":"manuscript","metadata: part name":"","metadata: partID":"MS-DD-00005-00005","overview: additions":"Collation formula and date of rebinding written on the rear pastedown by .Arthur Owen Owen, A.

The inscription is partially legible under U.V. light and includes the words 'johannes stukey magistri 1439'. A possible candidate for the author of the inscription is a medieval author known as 'John Meare' (or Mears), of Stukey, but his biographical details are not fully established. In his history of the city of Norwich, Francis Blomfield records a monk of Norwich Cathedral Priory: 'John Meare, or Mears, of Stukey, [...] D. D. of the University of Oxford, [who] flourished in the reign of King Edward IV. He wrote a book of sermons; and four books on the Master of the Sentences, which were preserved in the library of his monastery.' Johannes Stukey is also listed in Emden's A Biographical Register of the University of Oxford p. 1809, and is described as an author with theological works attributed to him, but Emden fixes that Stukey with dates of activity in the first half of the 14th century. Further work is needed to establish the context of the inscription in this manuscript.Johannes Stukey Johannes Stukey Emden, A Biographical Register of the University of Oxford, vol.

On f. 6v there is an example of the word ‘white’ being added by means of a circumflex between letters. More commonly, however, the scribe simply superscripts the missing letter over the place of omission (e.g. senato˹r˺es on f. 25r). Due to the scribe’s application of superscription both when correcting and abbreviating words, it is occasionally unclear which task is in action. This is particularly true where only one letter is superscripted when there has been an omission of several letters, as is the case on f. 26r where the scribe writes: ‘dist˹o˺ye’. The word fits best semantically as ‘dist(r)˹o˺ye’, however the superscription does not clearly denote this and is not a common abbreviation notation for ‘ro’. It could thus be equally viewed to serve as an idiosyncratic abbreviation or to fulfil a corrective function. This is particularly so given that two words later ‘torment’ is represented as ‘to˹r˺ment’ where one or both functions are in operation simultaneously.

Given the loss of the original text, this presumably replaces a parchment repair that was contemporary with the production of the manuscript.","locus: locus":"3r; 3a; 3a recto; 3r; 54","locus: from":"3r 3a recto 3a recto 3r 54r","locus: to":"3r 3a verso 3a recto 3r 54v","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"","bibliography: ref(s)":"","bibliography: ref URI(s)":""},{"metadata: addition UID":"_addition_5","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_1","metadata: collection":"","metadata: ms ID":"","metadata: shelfmark":"Cambridge, University Library, MS Gg.4.6","metadata: ms type":"manuscript","metadata: part name":"","metadata: partID":"MS-GG-00004-00006","overview: additions":"Pen trials, including possible names (?'Rutherskth' and another in an apparent cipher), on f. 142r.","locus: locus":"142r","locus: from":"142r","locus: to":"142r","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"","bibliography: ref(s)":"","bibliography: ref URI(s)":""},{"metadata: addition UID":"_addition_5","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_1","metadata: collection":"","metadata: ms ID":"","metadata: shelfmark":"","metadata: ms type":"manuscript","metadata: part name":"","metadata: partID":"MS-LL-00005-00018","overview: additions":"Additions: A strip of paper was pasted over the bottom quarter of f. 29r, although has since become loose revealing that which it covered. The material that has been covered is inverted and consists of three lines of writing and a signature. The writing fragment has been cut through to form the correct dimensions for the quarto. The paper that has been used to cover this is also scrap material being re-utilised, with writing covering its entirety and truncated by trimming on its outer and bottom edges. This suggests that the strip was cut specifically to fit the space it was required to cover. F. 29r appears mid-quire, however it marks the beginning of the excerpt taken from Augustine, which finishes well in advance of the material that required covering. The writing that follows the excerpt is a Latin couplet, with a matching (in both hand and form) Latin couplet occurring adjacently, and then a short piece of Latin writing in a separate hand and ink. The latter piece of writing, written in a seventeenth century hand, flows directly from the original page and onto the paste-over.","locus: locus":"f. 29r; F. 29r","locus: from":"29 pasteover (r) 29r","locus: to":"29 pasteover (v) 29v","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"","bibliography: ref(s)":"","bibliography: ref URI(s)":""},{"metadata: addition UID":"_addition_5","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_1","metadata: collection":"","metadata: ms ID":"","metadata: shelfmark":"Cambridge, University Library, MS Dd.12.23","metadata: ms type":"manuscript","metadata: part name":"","metadata: partID":"MS-DD-00012-00023","overview: additions":"Collation formula by the hand of , c. 1958 (H.L.

With sincere and great pleasure I present it to the Library of Emmanuel College, as a mark of my respect for the Master and Fellows of the Society in which I had the honour to be educated; and the Manuscript, I suppose, will be the more acceptable to them, as having once been the property of Dr Askew, and his son, who were Members of the same College, and who, like myself, took a lively interest in its Prosperity arid its Fame.

There have been later amendments to some of these, probably by the same hand as the alterations to the foliation.","locus: locus":"f. 175r; 41r; 165r; 254v; f. 62v; f. 63r; f. 65r","locus: from":"175r 41r 165r 254v 62v 63r 65r","locus: to":"175r 41r 165r 254v 62v 63r 65r","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"Henry Bradshaw (1831-1886); Bradshaw, Henry, 1831-1886","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"","bibliography: ref(s)":"","bibliography: ref URI(s)":""},{"metadata: addition UID":"_addition_1","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_12124","metadata: collection":"","metadata: ms ID":"","metadata: shelfmark":"Cambridge, University Library, MS Add. 3849","metadata: ms type":"part","metadata: part name":"","metadata: partID":"","overview: additions":"There are occasional brief annotations in Greek in the margins, in various hands.","locus: locus":"","locus: from":"","locus: to":"","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"","bibliography: ref(s)":"","bibliography: ref URI(s)":""},{"metadata: addition UID":"_addition_1","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_12125","metadata: collection":"","metadata: ms ID":"","metadata: shelfmark":"Cambridge, University Library, MS Add. 4173","metadata: ms type":"manuscript","metadata: part name":"","metadata: partID":"MS-ADD-04173","overview: additions":"On f. 3r there are a few modern notes in pencil.","locus: locus":"f. 3r","locus: from":"3r","locus: to":"3r","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"","bibliography: ref(s)":"","bibliography: ref URI(s)":""},{"metadata: addition UID":"_addition_2","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_12125","metadata: collection":"","metadata: ms ID":"","metadata: shelfmark":"Cambridge, University Library, MS Add. 4173","metadata: ms type":"manuscript","metadata: part name":"","metadata: partID":"MS-ADD-04173","overview: additions":"On f. 3v is pasted a label of Cambridge University Library.","locus: locus":"f. 3v","locus: from":"3v","locus: to":"3v","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"","bibliography: ref(s)":"","bibliography: ref URI(s)":""},{"metadata: addition UID":"_addition_3","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_12125","metadata: collection":"","metadata: ms ID":"","metadata: shelfmark":"Cambridge, University Library, MS Add. 4173","metadata: ms type":"manuscript","metadata: part name":"","metadata: partID":"MS-ADD-04173","overview: additions":"In the lower margin of f. 5r is written, in ink, the shelfmark, Add. 4173.","locus: locus":"f. 5r","locus: from":"5r","locus: to":"5r","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"","bibliography: ref(s)":"","bibliography: ref URI(s)":""},{"metadata: addition UID":"_addition_1","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_12127","metadata: collection":"","metadata: ms ID":"","metadata: shelfmark":"Cambridge, University Library, MS Add. 4489","metadata: ms type":"part","metadata: part name":"","metadata: partID":"","overview: additions":"There are marginal notes in pencil, in English, identifying texts and occasional incidents within them, and giving occasional page references to editions.

Moreover, an important number of discrepancies can be observed between the table of the kephalaia as presented before the Gospel of Luke (f. 137v) and the kephalaia headings found within the text of that Gospel. It appears that, in the table, the rubricator made some mistakes when writing the kephalaia numbers before the corresponding kephalaia titles previously written by the main scribe. Considering wrongly a line break as the start of a new kephalaion title, he attributed a new number to a line of text which turns out to be only the end of the title beginning in the previous line. In particular, the table erroneously considers […] τὴν κληρονομίαν as a new kephalaion title and gives it the number “46”, whereas it is only a part of section 45 (the actual section 46 being Περὶ οὗ εὐφόρησεν ἡ χώρα πλουσίου). From kephalaion 46 onwards, the numbering within table is consequently one number ahead of the headings present in the text. That gap remains until the rubricator makes the converse mistake, when he forgets to give a number to kephalaion 79 (ἐξουθένησις Ἡρώδου). That is why, from kephalaion 80 until the last one, kephalaion 83, the numberings of both the table and the text coincide once again. Furthermore, a mistake (this time made by the main scribe) is found in the kephalaia titles of the same table: kephalaion 58 (περὶ τοῦ οἰκονόμου τῆς ἀδικίας) was inadvertedly copied twice; once at its expected place, and a second time after kephalaion 59, Περὶ τοῦ πλουσίου καὶ τοῦ Λαζάρου, but without altering the numbering.","locus: locus":"137v","locus: from":"137v","locus: to":"137v","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"","bibliography: ref(s)":"","bibliography: ref URI(s)":""},{"metadata: addition UID":"_addition_2","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_12138","metadata: collection":"","metadata: ms ID":"","metadata: shelfmark":"","metadata: ms type":"manuscript","metadata: part name":"","metadata: partID":"MS-ADD-06594","overview: additions":"The lection notes are easily recognisable, being written in a small red-ink uncial. A lection note is generally composed of an indication on the time of the year the lesson is to be read, and a very brief sentence summarising its content. Within the body of the text, the extent of the passage to be read is delimited with the abbreviated forms of the words ἀρχή (\"start\") and τέλος (\"end\"). Three main sorts of rubricated lection notes can be distinguished: ones intended for the Saturday and Sunday lessons (the σαββατοκυριακαί lessons), which are respectively indicated σαβ. and κυρ.; ones for the 5 week days (the καθημεριναί lessons), which all start with an indication of the week and day the lesson is read; and finally ones intended for specific religious feasts, which are generally indicated with the name of the concerned feast. An important number of the lessons present in the margins of the Codex Macedoniensis coincide with those used in the traditional menologia, that is to say, the second section found in Byzantine lectionaries which supplied a Gospel reading for each day of the year. As in our manuscript, the menologia start the liturgical year on the 1st of September and end it on the 30th of August. Although those menological lections frequently overlap with the Saturday\/Sunday lessons and the five-day lessons, many of them are independent from the main lection system.","locus: locus":"","locus: from":"","locus: to":"","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"","bibliography: ref(s)":"","bibliography: ref URI(s)":""},{"metadata: addition UID":"_addition_3","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_12138","metadata: collection":"","metadata: ms ID":"","metadata: shelfmark":"","metadata: ms type":"manuscript","metadata: part name":"","metadata: partID":"MS-ADD-06594","overview: additions":"The menological lections present in Codex Macedoniensis are the following: Symeon Stylites, 1st September, Luke 4:16-22 (155r); Mammes of Alexandria, 2nd September, John 15:1 (292v); Babylas of Antioch, 4th September, Luke, 10:1-3, 8-12 (186v); Zacharias, 5th September, Matthew 23:29-39 (54v); Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary (independent), 8th September, Luke 10:38-42, 11:27-28 (190r); Elevation of the Holy Cross, 14th September, John 12:25-36, 3:13, 12:28, 19:6 (285r, 248v, 285r, 303v); Euphemia, 16th September, Luke 7:36-50 (171r); Pantaleon, 17th September, Luke 9:23-27 (182r); Eustace, 20th September, Luke 21:12-19 (225r); Gregory of Armenia (the Illuminator) , 30th September, Matthew 24:42 (59r); Dionysius the Aeropagite, 3rd October, Matthew 13:45 (20v); Zenaida, 11th October, Mark 13:33-37, 14:3 (124v); Luke, 18th October, Luke 10:16-21 (187v): Hilarion, 21st October, Luke 6:17-23 (164r); The Notaries, 25th October, Luke 12:2-7 (195v); Paul the Confessor (independent), 6th November, Luke 12:8-12 (196r); John Chrysostom, 13th November, John 10:9-16 (275v); The Holy of the Holies (independent), 21st November, Luke 1:39-49, 56 (142r); Barbara, 4th December, Mark 5:24-34 (96r); Thyrsus, 14th December, Luke 8:22-25 (175v), Ignatius, 20th December, Mark 9:33-41 (110r); The Eve of the Nativity of Christ (independent), 24th December, Luke 2:1-20; Saturday following Nativity of Christ (independent), Matthew, 12:15-21 (12v); Basil of Caesarea (independent), 1st January, Luke 2:20-21, 40 (147r, 149r); Sunday before Epiphany (independent), Mark 1:1-8 (81r); Epiphany, 6th January, Mark 1:9-15 (82r); The day after Epiphany (independent), 7th January, John 1:29-34 (243v); Euthymius, 20th January, Matthew 11:27-30 (11r); Clement of Ancyra (independent), 23rd January, Matthew 12:1-8 (11r); The Meeting of the Lord (independent), 2nd February, Luke 2:22-40 (147v); Simeon and Anna (independent), 3rd February, Luke 2:25-40 (148r); Tarasios of Constantinople, 23rd February, John 12:24-36 (284v); Martyrs of Sebaste, 9th March, Matthew 20:1-16 (40r); Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary (independent), 25th March, Luke 1:24-38 (141v); John the Evangelist, 8th May, John 19:25-27 (305v, 306r); Constantine and Helena, 21st May, Matthew 10:16-22 (6r); Elisha, 14th June, Luke 4:22-30 (155v); Birth of the Forerunner John the Baptist (independent), 24th June, Luke 1:1-25, 57, 76, 80 (138r); Peter and Paul (independent), 29th June, Matthew 16:13-19 (29r); Elijah, 20th July, Luke 4:22-30 (155v); Procession of the Venerable wood, 30th July, Matthew, 27:27-32 (73r); The Transfiguration (independent), 6th August, Luke 9:28-36, Matthew 27:1-9 (31r); The Beheading of the Forerunner (independent), 29th August, Mark 6:14-30 (98v).","locus: locus":"","locus: from":"","locus: to":"","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"","bibliography: ref(s)":"","bibliography: ref URI(s)":""},{"metadata: addition UID":"_addition_4","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_12138","metadata: collection":"","metadata: ms ID":"","metadata: shelfmark":"","metadata: ms type":"manuscript","metadata: part name":"","metadata: partID":"MS-ADD-06594","overview: additions":"The margins of the text also contain Eusebian canon numbers in red ink, which were added by the rubricator in the same small uncial script at the time of the production of the volume.

The surname of the dedicatee is unclear; it has been tentatively rendered as Βωρρὲ (Patrinelis) or Βωρρετή (Perentidis). He may be identifiable with Ivan (Iov) Borecki Borecki, Jan -1631 , later Metropolitan of Kiev (1620-1631), but this is very uncertain (Perentidis, Manuscrit, p. 216 n. 43, pp. 220-221). The first four words of this note (Θεοδόσιος δικαιοφύλαξ τοῦ πατριαρχείου) are written in a different ink and were probably added earlier than the rest.
