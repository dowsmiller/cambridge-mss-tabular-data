                            <seg type="para"> The main text of the manuscript is a 12th-century copy of the <hi rend="italic">Antidotarium
                                magnum</hi>, a text produced at the <placeName key="place_g7006732">Abbey of Montecassino</placeName> in the <date notAfter="1100" notBefore="1000">11th century</date> by or through the direction of a monk of Tunisian heritage
                                known to modern scholarship as <name key="person_v305230031">
                                    <persName type="display">Constantinus Africanus</persName>
                                    <persName type="standard">Constantinus Africanus, d. before 1098/1099</persName></name>. The <hi rend="italic">Antidotarium magnum</hi> was the first substantial medical work produced in western medieval Europe that
                                presented medical recipes and ideas from Arabic sources alongside recipes deriving from Greek, Roman, and subsequent
                                western European medical sources. The work has often been confused with a similar text, the <hi rend="italic">Antidotarium Nicholai</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Antidotarium paruum</hi>, which probably originates from the
                                medical school at Salerno, and is based, in part on the <hi rend="italic">Antidotarium magnum</hi>. Indeed, M.R. James
                                mistook the main text in this manuscript for the 'Antidotarium (Nicholai)' in his descriptive catalogue of 1907-14.
                                Indeed, M.R. James mistook the main text in this manuscript for the 'Antidotarium (Nicholai)' in his 1913 <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi> of the manuscripts of St John's College. The probable cause of the confusion of these
                                two antidotaria is the fact that the first recipe in both antidotaria pertains to <hi rend="italic">Aurea
                                    alexandrina</hi>. However, as Monica H. Green has observed, the <hi rend="italic">Antidotarium Nicholai</hi>
                                typically opens with a prefatory address by a 'Nicholaus', and the content of the <hi rend="italic">Aurea
                                    alexandrina</hi> recipes differs between the two. For further information see: <bibl>Monica H. Green, 'The <hi rend="italic">Antidotarium magnum</hi>: A Short Description' (2019)</bibl>, especially n. 19. </seg>

                                <p>Full bound in tawed skin over wood boards. The covering material is undecorated, but there are traces of a title in
                                    ink (perhaps 'Liber Nich...') on the left cover. Four sewing supports.</p>
                                <p>The manuscript has been rebound since M. R. James examined the volume for his <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi>
                                    which was published in two volumes in 1907-14. The original tawed skin cover has been detached and trimmed to fit
                                    within the perimeter of the outer faces of the wood boards, a new tawed skin cover has been applied over the wood
                                    boards, and then the original tawed skin cover has been replaced over the top of the newer covering material. The
                                    older tawed skin cover is heavily stained and rubbed, and there are large patches where layers of the skin have
                                    peeled or scraped off. When M. R. James examined the volume, he noted that it had 'red clasps, broken'; these
                                    clasps are not present on the current binding. Two small printed paper labels indicating the current shelfmark of
                                    the item are affixed to the spine, the upper label has the number '588' printed in red ink and the lower label has
                                    the number '366' printed in black ink.</p>
                                <p>The current binding has <date notBefore="1908">post-1908</date> paper pastedowns. The <locus from="inside_left_cover" to="inside_left_cover">left pastedown</locus> contains a Gonville and Caius armorial
                                    bookplate with the number '588' corrected from '585' handwritten in red ink, and the number '366' handwritten in
                                    black ink. The number '585' is written in pencil in the upper outer corner of the pastedown, and is probably an
                                    error for the shelfmark '588'. Leaves f. <locus from="i recto" to="i verso">i</locus> and f. <locus from="96r" to="96v">96</locus> were probably the pastedowns in an earlier binding, as both have adhesive residue on their

                                    <p>Each antidote begins with a decorative initial 2-3 lines high in the 'arabesque' style common in English and
                                        French manuscripts of this date. Each initial is rendered in red, blue, or green, with decorative pen
                                        flourishes in one of the two colours not used as the base-colour of the initial. Due to the structure of the
                                        text, there are typically 3-6 decorative initials per page in the manuscript.</p>
