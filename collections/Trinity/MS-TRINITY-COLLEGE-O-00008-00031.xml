                            <seg type="para">Cambridge, Trinity College, MS O.8.31 (hereafter Trinity MS O.8.31) is a composite manuscript that
                                contains a compilation of popular scientific treatises on subjects at the intersection of medicine and the
                                astronomical and astrological sciences. Comprising five main parts of varying date and place of origin, the manuscript
                                was almost certainly bound in its present form by the third quarter of the 15th century, since it was once owned or
                                used by <name key="person_v295191079" role="fmo">
                                    <persName type="display">Roger Marchall (c. 1417-1477)</persName>
                                    <persName type="standard">Rogerus Marshall -1477</persName>
                                </name>, a doctor and physician to Edward IV. Marchall added a table of contents on f. <locus from="iii verso"
                                    to="iii verso">iii verso</locus> (that given on f. <locus from="ii recto" to="ii recto">ii recto</locus> does not
                                relate to this manuscript, but to another lost or unidentified volume) and inserted rubrics to some of these treatises
                                where they appear in the manuscript. Texts matching the descriptions given by Marchall are to be found in four of the
                                five central Parts (nos 2-3 and 5-6), confirming that none of these is a later addition to the manuscript, though
                                there are some differences in attribution. For instance, the first and third texts in the table correspond to the
                                first and third texts in Part 2, the <hi rend="italic">Chirurgia</hi> of Henri de Mondeville (ff. <locus from="1r"
                                    to="63v">1r-63v</locus>) and the recipes from surgical treatises by Roger and Roland of Salerno (ff. <locus
                                    from="106r" to="108r">106r-108r</locus>). The text that sits between them, however, is described by Marchall as a
                                'Tractatus aquarum' and attributed to Petrus Hispanus, but as an 'Antidotarius' by Henri de Mondeville in the scribal
                                rubric that marks its beginning (f. <locus from="65r" to="65r">65r</locus>).</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Further disparities between the table of contents and what follows suggests that the manuscript has been
                                subject to some rearrangement, part of it at least at Marchall's hands. None of the texts in Part 4 is listed in
                                Marchall's table of contents, but these five quires must have been in his possession, since two of the texts are
                                prefaced by rubrics written by his hand (see ff. <locus from="132v" to="132v">132v</locus> and <locus from="134r"
                                    to="134r">134r</locus>). Notably, one of the two recipes in this Part for 'metheglyn', a spiced or medicated
                                variety of mead, is written in Middle English; Marchall's manuscripts typically contain texts written only in Latin.
                                Part 4 is preceded not by the deontological text Marchall described as 'De gestu medici erga infirmum' ('On the
                                conduct of a doctor towards the patient'), which is not found in the volume, but by the text he listed last in his
                                table: '8. Anothomia Magistri Ricardi' (ff. <locus from="113r" to="118v">113r-118v</locus>).</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Each Part of Trinity MS O.8.31 is written on paper and, as is sometimes found in books of this period,
                                the quires have been reinforced by sewing guards: strips of parchment placed along the spinefold around the back and
                                at the centre of each quire. It is often the case, as here, that these strips have been recycled from one or more
                                manuscripts (usually documents), and occasionally enough of the text may be read to afford some clues as to the
                                general location of the manuscript's binding and thus likely provenance (see <bibl subtype="internal" type="MS"><ref
                                        target="https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-DD-00005-00053/1">Cambridge, University Library, MS
                                    Dd.5.53</ref></bibl>, for example). Unfortunately, for this manuscript, the sewing guards were cut vertically from
                                their source, so only a couple of letters of a minute textualis bookhand are visible (see, for example, the image of
                                f. <locus from="5r" to="5r">5r</locus>). Nevertheless, the source manuscript appears to have contained works of a
                                scientific nature, since several of the guard strips bear brief sequences of medieval Hindu-Arabic numerals. Owing to
                                the condition of the binding, and the narrowness of each guard, it has not been possible to digitise these elements. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">Roger Marchall's ownership or use of manuscripts is very well-attested, with forty-five surviving books
                                (including this one) bearing evidence to connect him to them in some way; six others may have been his or accessed by
                                him, and a further twelve are recorded but not traced. Thirteen manuscripts owned or used by Marchall (and another
                                with possible Marchall connections) have been digitised, catalogued and conserved as part of the <ref

                                    <note><p>The core leaves (ff. 1-196) are foliated in ink in Hindu-Arabic numerals in the upper outer corner of
                                            each recto in an early modern hand. The early-modern foliation sequence is correct apart from a duplicate
                                            designation of folio '162'; a later foliator has supplied the designation '162a' to the second of those
                                            two leaves. The early modern foliator's numbering is clear except for a tendency to write the character
                                            '1' in a form that resembles a narrow modern '4'. M. R. James misread some of this foliator's 1s as 4s and
                                            thereby introduced minor foliation inconsistencies into his catalogue record for this item. </p>
                                        <p>The parchment endleaves are foliated in pencil in Roman numerals in the upper outer corner of each recto;
                                            the parchment endleaves at the beginning of the volume have the designations ff. i-iii and those at the
                                            rear of the volume have the designations iv-v. The paper endleaves at each end of the volume were assigned
                                            designations in 2024 when the manuscript was catalogued as part of the Curious Cures project in order to
                                            produce a functional TEI-XML record for this manuscript. The paper endleaves were assigned the
                                            designations ff. [a]-[b] for the leaves at the beginning of the volume and f. [c] for the paper leaf at
                                            the rear of the volume; these unofficial designations are enclosed in [square brackets] throughout this

                                    </name>. Marchall seems to have been interested in curating the manuscripts in his possession, and seems to have
                                    made (or comissioned) a number of codicological interventions in the volumes he owned; many of the surviving
                                    Marchall manuscripts (such as this one) are highly composite, and show signs of having been deliberately arranged
                                    for Marchall into their current codicological format.</p>
                                <p>Trinity MS O.8.31 contains narrow parchment sewing guards along the spinefold around the back and at the centre of
                                    each quire. They were probably added when the composite volume was bound in its current arrangement, most likely
                                    for Roger Marchall (see Introduction for further discussion). The guards are narrow (less than 10mm wide, prior to
                                    folding) and were cut vertically from their source, so only a couple of letters of a minute textualis bookhand can
                                    be read on each. Furthermore, the fragility of the binding has limited the degree to which the manuscript may be
                                    opened safely in order to inspect the guards. Nevertheless, the presence on several of brief sequences of medieval
                                    Hindu-Arabic numerals, and the style of handwriting, suggest that their source was a late 13th- or early
                                    14th-century book of scientific texts. </p>

                                    ownership inscription by a 15th-century hand. The name is uncertain, since the ascenders and descenders do not
                                    quite correspond with their placement for the name 'Iohannes'. but evidently this person was a medical
                                    practitioner in London. M.R. James suggested that the erased surname may have been 'Somerset', presumably thinking
                                    of John Somerset (d. 1454), physician and first supervisor of practitioners of surgery and medicine in London,
                                    however the littera notabilior at the beginning of the surname appears to be 'M'. </p>
