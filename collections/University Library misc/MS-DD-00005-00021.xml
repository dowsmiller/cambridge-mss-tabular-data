                            <seg type="para">In the 1960s, Ian Harwood established that nine music manuscripts in Cambridge University Library were
                                all copied by Matthew Holmes, who is recorded as the Precentor at Christ Church in Oxford from 1588, a post with
                                responsibility for instructing the choristers in singing and playing musical instruments (see Harwood (1963, 1964 and
                                2005)). In 1597, Holmes moved to London to take up the same job at Westminster Abbey, which he held until his death in
                                1621. Four of the manuscripts, with the shelf marks <bibl subtype="internal" type="MS"><ref

                                        target="https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-NN-00006-00036/1">MS Nn.6.36</ref></bibl>, form an overlapping
                                chronological series largely devoted to tablature for the solo renaissance lute (MS Dd.2.11 is also a major source of
                                tablature for solo bandora - over half of the music known for the instrument - and MS Nn.6.36 also includes music for
                                lyra viol and keyboard). Facsimiles of all four of these manuscripts of lute music are available on the Cambridge
                                Digital Library. A fifth manuscript of the nine that Holmes copied, with the shelf mark <bibl subtype="internal"
                                    type="MS">Dd.4.23</bibl>, comprises 86 pieces for solo cittern copied c. 1595 that is the largest and most
                                important surviving source of English music for this instrument. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The remaining four manuscripts by Holmes are books containing parts for four of the six instruments of
                                the mixed, or English, consort - which comprised lute, cittern, bandora, flute or recorder, treble viol and bass viol
                                - probably copied when he was in Oxford. These part books bear the shelf marks <bibl subtype="internal" type="MS">MS
                                    Dd.3.18</bibl>, <bibl subtype="internal" type="MS">MS Dd.5.20</bibl>, <bibl subtype="internal" type="MS">MS
                                    Dd.5.21</bibl> and <bibl subtype="internal" type="MS">MS Dd.14.24</bibl> and include mixed consort parts for lute,
                                bass viol, recorder and cittern, respectively. One of these - the recorder part - is reproduced here, and the others
                                part books will be added to the Digital Library in the future.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">No part books copied by Holmes are known for bandora and treble viol, the other two instruments of the
                                mixed consort, but they are presumed to have existed and are now lost. It has been assumed that Holmes used the
                                consort part books in his teaching of the choristers at Christ Church and then possibly the choristers at Westminster.
                                Alternatively he may have collected and copied the solo and consort music into the nine manuscripts as a reference
                                collection and archive as a life-long preoccupation.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Although housed together at Cambridge University Library and all copied by Holmes' hand, it is likely
                                that not all the four part books are from the same set of consort parts. Two of the books match exactly in size and
                                dimensions (275 x 210 mm) and were bound together at some stage, although they are currently bound separately. The
                                verso of the first folio of each bears the related inscriptions 'The Recorder P[ar]te' in MS Dd.5.21 and 'The Base
                                Vyall P[ar]te' in MS Dd.5.20, followed by a short list of the same ten items from amongst the contents of each (plus
                                an eleventh item added to the list in <locus from="1v" to="1v">MS Dd.5.21</locus>). These similarities suggest that
                                Dd.5.20 and Dd.5.21 are from the same set of consort parts, even though the music contained in them differ
                                considerably and is not in the same sequence. Only three-quarters of the consort parts in Dd.5.21 are also in
                                Dd.5.20.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The ninety-four items in MS Dd.5.21 are all mixed consort parts with eighty-eight for recorder plus six
                                parts for 'treble violan', a term probably referring to either treble viol or treble violin: five are headed 'Treble
                                Violan' on f. <locus from="2v" to="2v">2v</locus> that are presumed to have been copied into the recorder part book in
                                error. The sixth is one of two parts for Nightingale on f. <locus from="9v" to="9v">9v</locus>, probably one for
                                treble viol and the other for recorder. The music for each item in MS Dd.5.21 is mostly preceded by a G2/treble clef
                                and can be played on a tenor recorder. Sixteen items are preceded by a C clef [on middle C]: five on f. <locus
                                    from="3v" to="3v">3v</locus>, one on f. <locus from="6r" to="6r">6r</locus>, one on f. <locus from="8v" to="8v"
                                    >8v</locus>, one on f. <locus from="9r" to="9r">9r</locus>, one on f. <locus from="9v" to="9v">9v</locus>, three
                                on f. <locus from="10v" to="10v">10v</locus>, one on f. <locus from="11r" to="11r">11r</locus>, two on f. <locus
                                    from="11v" to="11v">11v</locus> and one on f. <locus from="12v" to="12v">12v</locus>. In these cases, recorder and
                                flute are given as alternatives in the inventory. The description of the contents of MS Dd.5.21 that accompanies the
                                digital facsimile shows the range of genres of mixed consort music typical of the English repertory from the 1580s
                                onwards and includes variations on Italian grounds and street songs [6], pavans [31], galliards [22], almaines [1],
                                jigs [6] and ballad tunes [14], many also known from settings for lute or other instruments. Warwick Edwards commented
                                on the accuracy of the consort parts suggesting they were difficult to perform because 'The recorder parts are ... of
                                poor quality, and are sometimes downright corrupt'. One explanation would be that the parts were arranged from
                                originals by the student choristers who played them and Holmes collected and copied them into his recorder part book. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The music in MS Dd.5.21 is mostly anonymous, although some items bear composer ascriptions, or
                                ascriptions are found in the parts for the same music in other Holmes part books, or in other sources. The major
                                figures of the second half of the sixteenth century represented are: Alfonso Ferrabosco the Elder, Nicholas Strogers,
                                John Johnson, Richard Allison, Anthony Holborne and John Dowland, presumably indicating that they were the composers
                                of the original compositions rather than the mixed consort settings (apart from Richard Allison, who published a book
                                of consort lessons in 1609 - see below). In addition, twenty-two items are ascribed to 'R Read'/'R R' (plus two more
                                in the other Holmes part books as well as four orpharion trios; see Spring (2000)) and three ascribed to 'R
                                Nicolson'/'Nic'/'N' in Dd.5.21 (plus one more in another Holmes part book). These are presumed to have been composed
                                or arranged for mixed consort by Richard Read, a singingman at Christ Church, Oxford between 1588 and 1617, graduating
                                as B. Mus at Christ Church on 7 July 1592 - and Richard Nicholson, organist of Magdalen College, Oxford from 1595
                                until 1638. Both were at Christ Church at the same time as Holmes, and may have participated in the performance of the
                                mixed consort music in Holmes' part books.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Four other sets of part books for mixed consort are known, all incomplete, and all with parts designated
                                for a flute instead of recorder. Three are printed collections: <hi rend="italic">The First Book of Consort
                                    Lessons</hi> by Thomas Morley, published in 1599 [parts for cittern, bandora, flute, treble viol and bass viol
                                survive], with a revised edition in 1611 [parts for <!--??cittern,--> bandora, flute and treble viol survive], and <hi
                                    rend="italic">Lessons for Consort</hi> by Philip Rosseter, published in 1609 [parts for cittern and flute, and
                                fragments of five items for lute survive]. The only manuscript set is the Walsingham Consort manuscripts, copied
                                around 1588 by a young Daniell Bacheler. Only one other mixed consort part book is known, a book of bandora mixed
                                consort parts interspersed with solos for lyra viol inscribed 'T B' on the cover, probably indicating Thomas Browne
                                (d. 1641) as the original owner, and in recent times in the library of Lord Braye but now in the The Robert Spencer
                                Collection at the Royal Academy of Music. In addition, a number of orphan consort parts for lute are found in a
                                variety of sources for solo lute.</seg>

                            <p>Ian Harwood identified Matthew Holmes (d. 1621) as the copyist of MS Dd.5.21 and eight other music manuscripts at
                                Cambridge University Library. This manuscript - one of four that contains parts for four of the six instruments of the
                                mixed, or English, consort - may have been while Holmes was in Oxford, working as Precentor at Christ Church, post he
                                held until 1597, when he moved to London for a similar position at Westminster Abbey.</p>
