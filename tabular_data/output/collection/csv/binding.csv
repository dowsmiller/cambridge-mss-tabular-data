_binding_1,manuscript_1,,,"Cambridge, Pembroke College, MS 258","Late-15th or early-16th century binding. The binding of Pembroke College MS 258 consists of three layers, each slightly larger than the largest bifolium in the volume, so that when the layers were stacked, sewn together, and folded in half, they formed a simple cover for the book-block. From outside to inside the cover, the three layers consist of: 1) a layer of semi-limp parchment; 2) a 'lining' layer made from layers of parchment documents from the reign of Edward IV pasted together; 3) a layer of linen cloth. The three layers are arranged a little like a quilted blanket, with the limp-parchment layer serving as the outer cover, the document layer functioning as the 'padding' or 'wadding' in the quilt, and the linen cloth layer serving as the 'backing', and forming the layer in contact with the text leaves. The three layers were originally sewn together all the way around the border of the cover with a linen thread; the sewing at the rear of the volume has since broken, and the various layers of the cover-structure are now exposed.; The quires of Pembroke College MS 258 are stab-sewn to the composite cover with vertical tacking stitches through the full thickness of the spine. Two paper labels fixed to the spine with an adhesive: a paper label with the Pembroke shelfmark '258' handwritten in ink, and a paper label with a handwritten list of some of the texts the spine.; The inside of the front cover contains: The name 'Goodwin' and the date '1496' in dark ink (this name also appears faintly on the front cover, and on the linen cover layer at the rear of the volume A note in ink 'bonum est Missam celebrare pro defunctis' The number '120' struck out and the number '258' written in bright pink ink A note in ink 'Evang: Iohannis Lat: cum Comm: Bedae et Augustini' A Pembroke College bookplate, mounted horizontally, dated 1879 Residue of a small oval wax seal or dark book label ; The documents used as the inner padding for the binding date from the reign of Edward IV (reg. 4 March 1461 to 3 October 1470 and 11 April 1471 to 9 April 1483). The documents mention the building of a chamber in Pety Alley (now Petty Wales), and also Blakmanstrete, Suthwerk, and Kenstrete. Blakmanstrete, Suthwerk, and Kenstrete are all places in London on the south bank of the river Thames. These documents are described in more detail in Part 8 in this record. ; This binding is similar in construction to Cambridge, University Library, Add. MS 6866, although Add.

Covers are each decorated with two concentric triple-fillet frames with Oxford corners, the outer frame set at the perimeter of the boards, and the inner frame offset by c. 30mm from the perimeter of the boards. The space inside the inner frame is further subdivided into three horizontal sections, the upper and lower sections filled with matching decorative motifs achieved with a zoomorphic panel stamp of pairs of squirrels, dragons, eagles and ?vulning ?pelicans set in round frames, and the central section filled with closely set repetitions of a small square stamp of two birds with necks entwined. ; On the left cover, an early modern hand has written a description of the volume very faintly in dark ink and now mostly faded: Liber [...] medicamendum cum alijs [...] ; On the right cover there is a fenestra with original horn layer and metal tacks; the handwritten label bears the title of one of the works in the volume 'Cure magistri poncii' (referring to the Curae of Pontius de Sancto Aegido on ff. 114r-140r). ; The overall design of the binding is similar to Flemish and then English bindings of the last quarter of the 15th century and the first quarter of the 16th century. As with most other finely cut decorative binding tools in use in England at this time, the zoomorphic panel stamp of four pairs of animals set in round frames was probably engraved in Flanders, and it may have been used there for a time before being imported into England. G. D. Hobson identified two other volumes that bear this stamp on their bindings: - California, Huntingdon Library, 59497 - A copy of the Nova statuta angliae printed by in London in 1484.

A digital facsimile of the manuscript and its binding can be viewed as part of the Mmmonk project here: Bruges, Bruges Seminary, MS 003/164; The manuscript has had a conservative recasing - the original stamped leather covers were lifted and new leather covers were wrapped around the wood boards, before the remains of the original leather covers were replaced on top of the new leather covers. Three raised bands on spine. Head and tail bands, if present, are capped by the replacement cover. The portion of the original leather covers over the back (i.e., the spine) of the volume is gone. The imprint of the original metal fittings for the fastening, probably a hook-and-catch clasp, is visible on the right cover, the original portion of the left cover at the site of the fastening has been torn away and the board underneath has a shallow irregular depression. ; Two small printed paper labels affixed to the spine '599' in red and '379' in black indicating the current Gonville and Caius shelfmark. ; See: Hobson, Blind-stamped panels in the English book-trade, c. 1485-1555 (1944), p. 10, fn. 1, and pl. 3b Oldham, Blind panels of English binders (1958), p. 18 and pl.

Eucherii liber de quaestionibus difficilioribus Vet. et Novi Testamenti...' (repeated on f. Cambridge, University Library, MS Ff.3.341r). They presumably remained bound together until at least 1760, since they were also listed together in the catalogue compiled by Frances Sawyer Parris (d. 1760), Protobibliothecarius 1750-1760 (now MS Oo.7.53-55). However, Parris repeated Tanner's descriptions verbatim, which raises some doubts as to whether his catalogue is an accurate reflection of the arrangement of the volumes at that time. Certainly, the manuscript was rebound during the 18th century, at the same time apparently as a number of other University Library manuscripts that bear the same covers: among them .MS Ee.4.29; Two things seem to have occurred at this juncture. Six leaves from MS Ee.4.29, having become separated from their original manuscript, made their way into MS Kk.5.13 and were bound into it - and their connection with MS Ee.4.29 was forgotten about: when F.J.A. Hort wrote his description of MS Ee.4.29 a century or so later in 1857, he was unaware of their existence. Only when Churchill Babington described MS Kk.5.13 a year later was the connection re-established. In unpublished notes, Charles Sayle recorded the leaves as being still in place during the period when he was revising descriptions of manuscripts in the two-letter classmark sequence (c. July 1911 to c. late 1920), and it appears that they were separated from MS Kk.5.13 and rebound at some point during that period. The binding is of a contemporary style and the classmark written therein is apparently by Sayle's hand. Certainly, they were separate by 1926-30, when MS Ee.4.29* was the subject of an unpublished description by M.R. James: see UA ULIB 7/3/74/18). The discrepancy between Babington's note of four leaves (repeated by Sayle) and the six leaves found in MS Ee.4.29* is most likely the result of miscounting, since the leaves are part of a conjoint quire. ; The second occurrence is that the leaves of Eucherius that had been separated from MS Kk.5.13 appear to have gone temporarily astray. They were evidently not rebound at the same time as MSS Kk.5.13 and Ee.4.29, since they do not share the same style of cover. They may have remained as loose leaves, perhaps in some sort of temporary folder or wrapper. Nothing after the classmark Ff.3.31 was recorded in Parris's catalogue, nor in that compiled by James Nasmith during 1794-96 (now MS Nn.6.42-45). However, as David McKitterick observed, the manuscripts that bear classmarks either side of the Eucherius - MSS Ff.3.33 and Ff.3.35 - are known to have been found among the effects of Richard Farmer, Protobibliothecarius from June/July 1778, following his death in 1797. It may be that the Eucherius was there too, or else happened to be re-absorbed into the collection at the same time, and placed into the binding that still houses it today.",,,,,,1800,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marchall seems to have been interested in curating the manuscripts in his possession, and seems to have made (or comissioned) a number of codicological interventions in the volumes he owned; many of the surviving Marchall manuscripts (such as this one) are highly composite, and show signs of having been deliberately arranged for Marchall into their current codicological format.Roger Marchall (c. 1417-1477) Rogerus Marshall (c. 1417-1477) ; Trinity MS O.8.31 contains narrow parchment sewing guards along the spinefold around the back and at the centre of each quire. They were probably added when the composite volume was bound in its current arrangement, most likely for Roger Marchall (see Introduction for further discussion). The guards are narrow (less than 10mm wide, prior to folding) and were cut vertically from their source, so only a couple of letters of a minute textualis bookhand can be read on each. Furthermore, the fragility of the binding has limited the degree to which the manuscript may be opened safely in order to inspect the guards.

_binding_3,manuscript_1,,,"Peterborough Cathedral, MS 1","The manuscript contains perhaps three sets of medieval endleaves, an accretion that reflects successive rebindings during the medieval period.; The first sets of endleaves appear to have been formed of gatherings of four leaves at the front (now ff. 1-4) and six leaves at the back (now ff. 377-381), of which the first and the last respectively were used as pastedowns. Damage to the lower edge of ff. 1-3 indicates the presence of a chain staple - but the fact that friction holes or rust stains have not transmitted to adjoining endleaves suggests that the manuscript was not chained again after this first binding was removed. ; When the manuscript was rebound, these pastedowns were lifted and bifolia added at the front (now ff. [viii]-[ix]) and the back (now ff. 382-383), again with the first and last leaves respectively serving as pastedowns. ; The manuscript was bound a third time, at which juncture the pastedowns were once again lifted. That these rebindings took place during the medieval period is evinced by the presence of notes by late 14th-/early 15th-century hands on ff. [viii] recto and 383v, which were only accessible once they had been lifted. The notes on f. 383v concern the reigns of abbots of Peterborough, with the final name, Henry of Morcott, providing a terminus ante quem non for the third rebinding of 1353. At this third rebinding, more leaves were added on either side of the volume: at the front, two gatherings of four leaves (now ff. [i]-[vii]), and at the rear, three gatherings of four leaves (now ff. [x]-[xx]). Some losses had occurred at that point or later: the first leaf of the first gathering at the front (before f. [i]) and the second leaf of the gathering at the back (after f. [xviii]). Again, the first and last leaves in these groups respectively (f. [i] and [xx]) were pasted down. ; A decorated hooked catch, not contemporary with the production of the manuscript, but certainly medieval and probably itself recycled from a larger manuscript, was reused in one of the later medieval rebindings of the manuscript and subsequently retained and reused as part of the ?16th/?17th-century binding (see above for further details).",,,,,,1500,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sewn in unsupported loop stitch, with three sewing stations prepared as v-notches.; Primary endbands are in the classic Greek style, wound with a cream thread and extending approximately one-fifth of the way onto the boards. The lower core is wound diagonally and the upper vertically. Remnants of yellow and blue threads that would have created a decorative secondary endband remain.; Textile transverse continuous spine lining can be seen, which extends at least a quarter of the way onto the boards.; There are pastedowns of plain paper. The left pastedown is integral, with sewing passing through a fold suggesting that the pastedown is a bifolio where both elements (at least one a full leaf) have been pasted down. The right pastedown may have had the same construction but in its present condition it cannot be determined whether the sewing passed through a fold or if there is a second leaf which can therefore be described as a separate pastedown.; The board attachment is bridling, the thread first passes through the outer face of the board, from which point a lacing path cannot be confirmed.; The boards are wooden, with grooved edges. The outer spine edge is rounded to meet the shoulder of the textblock.; There is full covering in dark brown leather with remnants of a red velvet secondary covering over the top. Over the boards there is faint blind tooling which is partially obscured by the secondary velvet covering. The edges of the boards are tooled with a double fillet boarder. Repetition of a diamond-shaped tool containing a double-headed eagle creates a border inside the double fillet. Inside this is a border of decorative lacing. Within the lacing there is a final double fillet border within which double fillets are used to create an undetermined intersecting pattern. At the intersections small roundels are used.

There are four sewing stations prepared with shallow v-shaped recesses.; Remnants of laid paper pastedowns remain on the inner face of the right and left boards.; Projecting compound endbands are present at the head and tail. The primary sewing is a single core woven endband sewn in natural coloured thread and sewn through the centre fold of each gathering. To facilitate the weaving, warp threads have been created by winding thread around the primary endband. The weaving is in a chevron pattern made with alternate red and yellow silk threads. The endbands extend approximately one quarter of the way onto each board. Where they extend onto the boards the endband is tied down to the head-most sewing stations and the tailband is tied down to the tail-most sewing stations.; Evidence of an overall spine lining can be seen at the inner joints and through damage in the covering, extending at least a third of the board width.; The board attachment is a zig zag pattern consistent with the Eastern Mediterranean tradition.; There are four attachment stations, each consisting of a pair of holes perpendicular to the spine, with a recess cut between each hole. The sewing thread is wound between each pair of holes (the sewing path on the outside of the board is obscured by the covering).; The start/end of the sewing thread can be seen at the head-most station of the left board and the tail-most section of the right board, tied off to the sewing thread as it passes to the next attachment station.; The boards are made from wood. The head-, tail- and fore-edges of the boards are square cut, measuring 10mm thick. The outer spine edge of the boards are shaped to a gentle round to meet the spine of the textblock.; Full covering in a dark red-brown tanned skin. The turn-ins suggest the skin was originally a red colour. The turn-ins are rough-trimmed and the corners are sewn-mitres.; Through the thickness of the left board is a hole, in the centre towards the foredge, which likely held a metal fastening. There are two corresponding holes through the right board, in the centre toward the foredge, which would have held a strap.; The cover is decorated with blind tooling. The tooling is of a varied design using only two tools - a wide double lines and a rectangular tool with a central dash.; The tooling on the left board consists of two concentric frames created with double lines. Additional double diagonal lines start at the corners of the board, intersecting the corners of the frames and terminating at the innermost frame. Where the diagonals intersect the frames the rectangular tool is used. To fill the space between the outside of the board and the outer frame the rectangular tool is used to form a ‘zig-zag’ pattern, with each impression made perpendicular to the previous, running along the border. Between the frames the rectangular tool has been used to spell out the name of the four evangelists. Within the second (and central) frame is a cross formed of the same rectangular tool. There is evidence in the form of pin holes that there was once a metal furniture cross in this position. Surrounding the cross is the inscription Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς νίκα, made with the same rectangular tool.; The tooling on the right board consists of two concentric frames created with double lines. Additional double lines diagonals start at the corners of the board, intersecting the corners of the frames, each pair from the head corners and tail corners terminate as they meet, approximately 80mm from the head and tail, respectively.

The sewing is an unsupported loop-stitch.; Both left and right endleaves are made from reused parchment manuscript and comprise of a full-size leaf and a stub folded inwards towards the textblock. The full-size leaves are pastedowns that have now become unstuck.; Projecting wound endbands are present at the head and tail. They are sewn in a natural-coloured thread and extend approximately a quarter of the way onto the boards. Where the endbands extend onto each board they are tied down to three holes drilled through the thickness of the board.; Evidence of an overall spine lining can be seen at the inner joints; how far the lining extends onto the boards cannot be determined.; The board attachment is bridling. There are three attachment stations each consisting of a pair of drilled holes perpendicular to the spine, with a recess cut between each hole. The sewing thread is wound between each pair of holes (the sewing path on the outside of the board is obscured by the covering). The start/end of the sewing thread can be seen at the tail-most station on the left board and the head-most station of the right board, held under other winds of thread to secure.; The boards are made from wood. The head-, tail- and fore-edge of both boards are grooved.

Remnants of the corresponding tanned skin straps can be found towards the fore-edge of the right board, cut flush with the outer face of the board but left long on the inner face. Four pieces of leather remain, evenly passing through a pair of holes. It is likely that the straps would have been braided and held a metal open pin-clasp.; At the top of the right board, in the centre, is a title frame secured with six brass coloured metal pins.

Both boards follow the same tooling pattern, which consists of a number of concentric frames created with two-line fillets. The central frame contains five round, double-headed eagle, intaglio tools aligned from head to tail. This frame is intersected with six small star tools at each long edge. The second frame is filled with lozenge-shaped, floral, intaglio tools rotated so the base faces the centre frame. The second frame intersects the third frame, which contains small star tools, six along the long side and three the short side. Additionally, four small star tools are used in each corner at the points which the second and third frame intersect. The fourth frame is filled with a small round tool containing a tree. The fourth frame intersects the boarder frame. The boarder frame contains small star tools, eight along the long side and five the short side.

_binding_1,manuscript_12107,,,MS Add. 2603,"Laid burnished paper textblock. Manuscript lettering on the tail edge.; Six sewing stations including two kettle stitches, the other four prepared with v-notches. Sewing is an unsupported loop-stitch with a Z-twist sewing thread.; The headband is mostly missing, with small remnants towards the left board. The tailband is completely missing apart from remnants on the boards. Greek-style compound endbands extending on approximatively one quarter of the wooden board width. Woven endbands over additional thin cord cores (4 in total) creating a chevron pattern with red and cream threads.; The spine lining consists of two layers of plain textile, extending onto the outside of the boards up to one third of their width. Remnants of sewing threads across the spine width towards the head and tail might suggest a sewing attachment of the two textile layers.; There are no pastedowns. Both endleaves are made of parchment manuscript waste; the left endleaf is a bifolio with a stub toward the board, the right endleaf is a full bifolio with a red seal on the second flyleaf towards the tail edge. The endleaves were sewn at the same time as the textblock.; Two wooden boards with vertical grain attached with bridling. The threads enter the boards through the outer face. The attachment is concealed on the inner boards by small pieces of wood adhered over the bridling stations. The textblock is flush with the boards, which are shaped at the spine edge only to create a gentle curve to the spine. All three edges have v-shaped grooves.; Full covering of dark brown tanned skin with extensive losses on the spine. Mitred corners at the turn-ins, with patches of leather close to the endbands. The corners at the right board do not match. The head and tail turn-ins on the right board were patched up to compensate for a shortage of leather, the new pieces being neatly sewn along the edges. The leather was also cut out were the straps were located, the tail strap holes only being covered with a new patch of leather.; Four sets of three holes with leather remnants are visible on the inside of the right board, one set at the head and tail, two sets at the foredge. There are two metallic pins on the foredge of the left board corresponding to the straps location. Two holes at the head and tail edges of the same board are also visible, which likely held two pins.; Three pieces of heart shaped furniture, one on the left board, two on the right board. Metallic remnants visible in the inner sides of both boards at the corners, centre of the spine and foredges and through the middle of the boards show evidence that there was seven pieces of furniture on each board.

The textblock is cut level to the bookboards.; There are three sewing stations prepared as v-notches. The sewing is an unsupported loop stitch.; Greek-style endbands with a cream coloured thread wound around a single core. The endbands extend approximately one quarter of the way onto the board. Where the endbands extend onto each board they are tied down to three holes that extend through the board - from the inner face to the outer face.; The transverse continuous spine lining is made of a textile with a printed pattern. The spine lining extends to one third of the way onto the left board and half of the way onto the right board.; The board attachment is bridling. The sewing thread enters at the spine edge of the boards, emerges on the inner face and then travels to the outer face, where the path would presumably change stations (the sewing path on the outer face of the boards is obscured by the spine lining). There is a single knot present on the inner face of both boards, next to the uppermost sewing station. This is likely to be the start of the sewing and therefore suggests that the textblock was sewn in two halves.; The boards are made from wood. The edges are square on both boards, except the outer spine edge where they have been shaped to form a round that meets with the shoulder of the textblock.; Full covering of dark brown leather.; Two of the turn-ins do not meet, one on each board; two of them are overlapping.; A single metallic pin is set into the centre of the foredge of the left board. Corresponding to the pin there are three holes through the right board that contain remnants of a leather strap.

(on the rear) (?pewter, all now tarnished).; A report by Sandy Cockerell - entitled 'Repairing and Rebinding the Codex Bezae' - is kept separately, along with several black-and-white photographs of the manuscript and the rebinding work in progress. Dated November 1965, but beginning with a description of the condition of the manuscript dated January 1962, the report suggests that the project to conserve and rebind Codex Bezae took place over several years. According to Cockerell:; The manuscript had been removed from the 19th century binding at some time and in removing it a great deal of damage had been done to the folds of the vellum leaves, particularly to the outside fold of each gathering. ; It is not clear when this removal took place, but other notes imply that this occurred during the Librarianship of Henry Bradshaw (b. 1831, d. 1886, Librarian 1867-1886): specifically, a collation diagram by Bradshaw's hand, which describes the structure of the quires and concludes 'all in box Aug 25' and 'together with Bezae's letter + seal Sept. 3' (no year is given). This sheet then continued to be used by subsequent members of Library staff as a means of checking that all of the leaves were present: it is signed 'all here' by Francis Jenkinson on 30 September 1898, and by H.L. Pink on 14 December 1949, 5 December 1952 and 26 January 1962.; Bradshaw's notes indicate that Codex Bezae was kept disbound in a box and this seems to have been the case until Cockerell's rebinding work. Another note, written by H.R. Creswick (1902-1988, Librarian 1949-1967), states '4 Red boxes inspected 9 Dec. 1949 HRC & HLP [i.e. H.L. Pink] & JCTO [i.e. J.C.T. Oates]. All the Manuscript is in good state'. An index card bears the notes by several members of staff between 4 June 1904 and 16 May 1963, recording the removal of selected leaves for display in the Library's show cases. In some cases, the display was just for a single day, notes regarding their removal and return beearing the same date, however in other instances it appears that leaves from Codex Bezae remained on view for extended periods: a note by H.R. Creswick concerning unspecified folios states 'In show case since 1926 at least, returned to box 9 May 1934 (Librarian's order to clear show cases)' (presumably in preparation for the re-location of the Library to the new building on West Road).",,,,,1800,1900,,,279 279,279 279,279 279,250 252,250 252,250 252,52 71,52 71,52 71,mm

The sewing is unsupported loop-stitch with a Z-twist sewing thread.; There are classic Greek endbands extending approximately ¼ of the way onto the boards. They are sewn around two cord cores. The lower is diagonal and the upper is wound vertically. Both endbands have broken threads. The headband is complete, the tailband is partially missing.; The cloth spine lining extends up to one third of the board. The endband tiedowns pass through the cloth.; Board attachment is bridling passing from the outside face of the board to the inner face and then back out. Channels are visible on the outside and inner faces of the boards to accommodate the threads. The boards are wooden, with slightly grooved edges, and the inner spine edges are shaped to form a round that nestles in the textblock shoulders.; There is a full covering of dark red tanned skin. The skin has been patched on both boards; one piece has been added, which extends from the upper left part of the left board to the upper part of the right board. This piece has been stitched in place with a natural coloured thread. An additional triangular piece is visible on the upper turn-in of the right board foredge. The turn-ins are now all open-mitred.; On the left board there are two metal bosses in the middle of the board, one towards the spinedge and one towards the foredge. There are remnants of two other bosses on the left board, and remnants of four bosses at the corners of the right board. On the left board, marks of four larger round pieces are visible on the four corners; those areas might have been covered by round metallic plates, held in place by pins. One pin is visible on one of those holes on the bottom right corner. Several smaller holes are also spread across both boards, suggesting the presence of smaller metallic furniture pieces.; There is a metallic pin on the left board foredge. Another hole is visible next to this pin on the left hand side; and two other holes are visible on the lower part of the foredge. Those holes suggest the previous presence of metallic pins. There are remnants of cord ties on the inside of the right board, going through two holes on the lower part of the right board; and through two out of three holes on the upper part of the right board.; Decoration uses blind tooling with intaglio hand-tools and fillets. On the left board, two vegetative rolls framed with double fillet borders extend from to the outer edges towards the centre. A central cross fills the central panel, the cross being framed by a single fillet with floral tool on the corners. Small holes on the cross suggest the previous presence of metallic furniture or gems. Double fillets are visible starting from the upper right corner of the frame, and disappearing where the cross motif starts. Smaller hand tools are visible on the frame corners. On the right board, there are two vegetative rolls framed with double fillet borders extending from to the outer edges towards the centre.

The sewing thread passes between the holes in an S-pattern on the inside of the board from head to tail. Recesses are cut for the thread to pass between each pair but not for the diagonal thread. One end of the sewing thread can be seen at the uppermost pair of sewing attachment holes. There is one hole just below the uppermost pair of sewing attachment holes which contains thread remnants, though its use is unclear.; A pair of anchor holes at head and tail exist to accommodate the endband sewing tie downs. They are no further than 25mm from the spine edge of the board and no further than 20mm from the head- or tail-edge. Three endband threads remain, very similar to the sewing thread, passing through the endbanding holes closest to the spine edge and three through the next, at both head and tail. Recesses are cut for the endband threads to pass on the outside face of the board only.; Two groups of three holes, in a triangular pattern, exist towards the fore-edge of the board, these holes possibly indicate the presence of straps at one point. It is unclear whether the three holes are a set or a pair and a single.; Remnants of a textile spine lining exist, passing over the spine edge of the board and extending onto the outer face.; Patches of parchment, and possibly tawed skin (seen on the outer face of the board but obscured by a later parchment sheet on the inner face) have been used to repair a split in the board, which can be detected at the head edge. A sheet of parchment, almost the size of the board, is adhered to the inner face of the board, probably once again to stabilise splits in the board.; Remnants of previous leather coverings exist, at the outer face towards the spine edge of the board and as turn-ins at the head and tail on the inner face of the board.",,,,,1000,1860,,gregorian,,,,,,,,,,
