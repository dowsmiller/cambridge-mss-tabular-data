                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">During the medieval period, history did not officially form part of the curriculum taught at
                                universities. However, it fulfilled an important ancillary role to theology, one of the higher faculties of study.
                                According to the writings of Hugh of St Victor (c. 1096-1141), a canon of the abbey of St Victor in Paris, there were
                                three approaches to reading the Scriptures: historical, allegorical and tropological. Hugh reasoned that history - in
                                the sense of the correct sequence of past events, but also the literal sense of any narrative, and both with specific
                                reference to the Bible - was the foundation upon which must rest any subsequent figurative interpretation of the Bible
                                as a source of moral guidance. To this end, Hugh advocated the training of one's memory and the use of mnemonic
                                techniques. These were complemented by simultaneous changes in the presentation of texts in manuscripts: specifically,
                                the creation of paratextual apparatus and visual cues to facilitate the accessing and comprehension of the text they
                                accompanied, or another to which it referred, by their readers.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The individual contents of this manuscript, their selection for compilation within a single volume, and
                                the manner in which they were presented illustrate the development and dissemination of these new intellectual and
                                bibliographical trends. It comprises three texts, the first two of which were composed to aid the understanding of
                                biblical history: the <hi rend="italic">Historia scholastica</hi> of Peter Comestor (d. 1187) and the <hi rend="italic">Genealogia historiarum</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Compendium historiae in genealogia Christi</hi>)
                                of Peter of Poitiers (c. 1130-c. 1205). The third text, the <hi rend="italic">Allegoriae in uetus testamentum</hi>,
                                was written by Richard of St Victor (d. 1173), a pupil of Hugh's, and exemplifies the figurative modes of reading the
                                Bible by describing the allegorical meanings to be found in the names of people, places or events related in the Old
                                Testament.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The <hi rend="italic">Historia scholastica</hi> occupies the bulk of this manuscript, and the text
                                represents an attempt to put Hugh of St Victor's ideas into practice. Comestor organised his narrative according to
                                the order of the books of the Bible, with each of its constituent histories corresponding to a biblical book or
                                collection of books, and thus providing the reader with a historical foundation for the study of the scriptures. In
                                many places, the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> was presented using parallel columns, which enabled Comestor to
                                accommodate his incidental observations without interrupting the framework of the events narrated in the Bible. In
                                this manuscript, these take the form of improvised sub-columns, their text demarcated from the rest by rubricated
                                lines that appear to have been drawn freehand and after the text had been copied (see f. <locus from="16r" to="16r">16r</locus> for extensive examples in both columns, and note how the rubricated line frequently runs over parts
                                of letters).</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Similar experimentation with layout is found in the first text in this manuscript, the <hi rend="italic">Compendium historiae in genealogia Christi</hi> of Peter of Poitiers. The two authors were close contemporaries -
                                Comestor served as Chancellor of Notre Dame and Dean of the cathedral school, before being succeeded by Peter of
                                Poitiers in 1169 - and their two texts commonly accompanied one another in manuscripts. Although in this manuscript
                                the <hi rend="italic">Compendium</hi> is apparently of separate production - on a separate quire of six leaves
                                (constrasting with the quires of eight found in the rest of the book), its text copied by a different hand, and
                                decorated with a different set of pigments that have in places corroded the parchment (such damage not being found
                                elsewhere) - there is no reason to suppose that they were not produced around the same time and with the intention
                                from the outset or at an early stage that they should be bound together in a single volume. Poitiers' work is
                                essentially a family tree: it condenses Old Testament history in order to illustrate Jesus's descent from Adam. In
                                this manuscript, the names of individuals are enclosed in roundels, the most important being picked out in gold, and
                                their relationship to one another is shown by interconnecting coloured lines. Interspersed among the parts of the
                                genealogy are multiple columns of text, providing the reader with additional information concerning specific people,
                                places or historical events. There are also schematic diagrams: first of Noah's ark (one derived from description in
                                the Book of Genesis; and one from the 1st-century Jewish historian Josephus's <hi rend="italic">Antiquitates
                                    iudaicae</hi>), then the three mansions in the desert and the Tabernacle, and finally the habitation of the king
                                and priests of Israel. In keeping with Hugh of St Victor's precepts, these illustrations - and the genealogical
                                diagrams as a whole - were intended as aids to memory, providing visual points of reference for the mental arrangement
                                of historical information transmitted to the reader in the text.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The close association of these two texts appears to have led at an early stage to the expansion of the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Compendium</hi> with material from the <hi rend="italic">Historia scholastica</hi> as well as
                                other sources (the range of illustrations also varied in later, expanded versions). This manuscript is notable as
                                perhaps the earliest extant copy of the 'interpolated' version of the <hi rend="italic">Compendium</hi> made in
                                England. Dating to the late 12th century, it furthermore illustrates the rapid dissemination of these new intellectual
                                currents from the University of Paris to centres of scholarship elsewhere in Europe.</seg>

                                    <p>The manuscript is grimy throughout. The red, green and blue pigment is often rubbed off or abraded in varying
                                        degrees of severity (see ff. <locus from="16r" to="16r">16r</locus>, <locus from="18r" to="18r">18r</locus>,
                                            <locus from="127v" to="127v">127v</locus>, <locus from="149r" to="149r">149r</locus> and <locus from="257r" to="257r">257r</locus>). There staining, largely in the upper part of the leaves, which
                                        worsens towards the rear of the manuscript (see ff. <locus from="261r" to="261r">261</locus> and <locus from="278r" to="279v">278-279</locus>). There are a number of leaves with areas that have been turned in
                                        and which now protrude beyond the edges of the leaves, which indicates that the manuscript has been trimmed
                                        (see ff. <locus from="88r" to="88r">88r</locus>). The manuscript has suffered from excessive rounding and the
                                        addition of a large amount of adhesive on the spine (see, for example, ff. <locus from="102r" to="103v">102-103</locus>, which has induced a considerable amount of cockling, pleating and folding of the leaves
                                        (see ff. <locus from="240r" to="240v">240</locus>, <locus from="243r" to="243v">243</locus> and <locus from="247r" to="247v">247</locus>). The last leaf is mutilated (f. <locus from="285r" to="285v">285</locus>), with loss of text.</p>
                                    <p>Quire 1 is in a particularly fragile condition (ff. <locus from="1r" to="6v">1-6</locus>), owing to the use of
                                        verdigris in the green pigment for some of the lines of descent. In places, this has burnt through the
                                        parchment, leaving the surrounding area brittle and vulnerable to loss and tearing. Portions of the lower
                                        edges and corners are also missing, perhaps also as a consequence of burn-through. </p>
