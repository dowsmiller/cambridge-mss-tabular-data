                        <summary>
                            <p>This manuscript contains the only known copy of the <hi rend="italic">Speculum historiale de gestis regum Anglie</hi>
                                of Richard of Cirencester (b. before 1340, d. 1400), monk of Westminster Abbey. A few records of Richard's life
                                survive. He was first recorded as a novice in 1354-55; said his first Mass in 1361-62; and spent a brief period in
                                1364-1365 at Gloucester College, the Benedictine house in Oxford, before returning to his native abbey and likely
                                beginning the compilation of this chronicle shortly thereafter. He held a couple of offices at intervals during his
                                life: precentor, and later warden of the lady chapel between 1382 and 1383. In 1391, he was granted a license to go to
                                Rome, but it is not known whether or not he made the journey. His presence in the abbey infirmary was recorded in
                                1400, the year in which he is thought to have died.</p>
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Speculum historiale</hi> is divided into four books, covering the period 447 to 1066, with much
                                of its contents derived from other, mainly chronicle, sources. At the end of this manuscript, a rubric records the
                                author's intention to compose a second part, commencing with the birth of William the Conqueror, but no such
                                continuation has been identified and it is unlikely that it was ever written (see Additions). Set within the context
                                of this broader narrative are substantial sections devoted to the history of Westminster Abbey. Its foundation is
                                described at length (ff. <locus from="29v" to="31v">29v-31v</locus>); a tract by William of Sudbury, another monk of
                                Westminster, was inserted in its entirety (ff. <locus from="140v" to="145v">140v-145v</locus>) and most of the fourth
                                book is dedicated to the life and miracles of Edward the Confessor, the abbey's patron saint (f. <locus from="208v"
                                    to="208v">208v</locus> onwards).</p>
                            <p>Claims relating to the manuscript's medieval provenance rest on an observation by J.E.B. Mayor, who edited the text as
                                part of the Rolls Series: 'As the initials of the chapters relating to Westminster Abbey are specially elaborate, we
                                may infer that this was the Abbey copy of the book' (<bibl>Mayor, vol. 2, p. clxv</bibl>). The first such initial
                                occurs at the start of the chapter concerning the dedication of Westminster and the appointment of two bishops,
                                Mellitus and Justus, by Augustine (d. 604), missionary and first archbishop of Canterbury (f. <locus from="29v"
                                    to="29v">29v</locus>). Similar such initials are found at the beginning of a dozen other chapters, however the
                                connection between their subject-matter and Westminster is less clear. The manuscript was not included among those
                                listed as belonging to Westminster in <bibl>Neil Ker, <hi rend="italic"> Medieval Libraries of Great Britain</hi>, 2nd
                                    ed. (1964), p. 196</bibl> (nor is it in its digital successor, <ref target="http://mlgb3.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/">
                                    <hi rend="italic">MLGB3</hi>
                                </ref>). The approximate date of the manuscript's production, based on palaeographical evidence, suggests that it was
                                copied within Richard's own lifetime, however. Given that no other copies are recorded in any surviving medieval
                                book-list or inventory, its circulation appears to have been strictly limited - but whether this is the only copy that
                                was ever made, and might be therefore the author's own copy, cannot presently be determined. Certainly, it cannot
                                wholly be his autograph, since three hands were involved in its production, but it is possible that this represents a
                                clean copy produced by amanuenses working for or in collaboration with Richard himself.</p>
