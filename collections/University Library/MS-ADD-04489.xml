                                    <title>Gospel lectionary palimpsest, with Menologion
                                    undertext</title>. The original manuscript, in majuscule script,
                                was probably produced in the late 8th century and converted into a
                                palimpsest in the late 13th or 14th century. The original bifolios
                                were cut into their component folios, of which 15 and a half survive
                                here, which were turned onto their side and folded into bifolios of
                                the overwritten manuscript. The undertext survives in a readily
                                legible state. The folios are now arranged to reflect the order and
                                orientation of the more important undertext.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The original manuscript was a Menologion, a term which
                                can refer to various types of liturgical text with a calendrical
                                structure, in this case denoting the book containing brief Lives of
                                the Saints to be read on the feast day of each saint. The surviving
                                folios are discontinuous but contain all or part of various entries
                                from 9 May to 11 July. The most important of these are an apparently
                                unique text of the Life of St Hyacinthus, a distinctive version of
                                the Life of Theophanes and Pansemne, and the Passion of Justin
                                Martyr, a text for which this is the oldest surviving witness,
                                though it is not believed to represent the oldest surviving
                                recension (Lanata, <hi rend="italic">Atti dei martiri</hi>, p.
                                117).</seg>
                            <seg type="para">These leaves were converted into a palimpsest for the
                                purpose of replacing losses to an existing Gospel lectionary, itself
                                probably created in the 12th century. They were arranged for this
                                purpose in a haphazard sequence bearing no particular relationship
                                to their original order, while some were placed the opposite way up
                                from others.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The remainder of the lectionary manuscript is now <bibl subtype="external" type="MS">Athens, Ethnike Bibliotheke tes
                                    Hellados (EBE), MS 4079</bibl>. (It had in the past been
                                erroneously identified as <ref target="http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Egerton_MS_3154">London, British Library, Egerton MS 3154</ref>.) When described
                                by former owner F.H.A. Scrivener, at some point before his death in
                                1891, the manuscript still included these palimpsest folios, but
                                they had been removed by 1909, when they were sold to Cambridge
                                University Library by Scrivener's daughter Frances. The identity of
                                the Athens manuscript as the one from which they came is confirmed
                                by the fact that, while 31 of the 32 lectionary folios here are
                                palimpsest material, the other is an original folio of the
                                lectionary, whose script and other details match those of the Athens
                                manuscript, a good-quality production with gilded headings and
                                initials. Their content also fits into the gaps in the sequence of
                                lections left by that manuscript's incomplete condition.

                                    14</locus> in the reconstituted sequence of the Menologion
                                leaves, was formerly attached by a paper strip to the other half of
                                    <locus from="14r" to="14v">f. 14</locus>, which is f. 32 of the
                                lectionary leaves. It forms the first folio of a quire whose
                                original first folio, the conjoint leaf of f. 32, had been removed.
                                Presumably it was the sole survivor of its own original quire, and
                                was deliberately incorporated into a quire of the replacement
                                palimpsest material when this was used to repair the lectionary.
                                Following its repair, but before its description by Scrivener, the
                                lectionary evidently suffered further losses, resulting in the
                                incomplete condition of the quires whose leaves are preserved
                                here.</seg>
