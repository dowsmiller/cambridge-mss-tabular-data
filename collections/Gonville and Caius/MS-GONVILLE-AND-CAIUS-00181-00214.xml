                            <seg type="para">This is a composite manuscript with the Parts comprised of both parchment and paper quires. In addition,
                                there are medieval parchment and paper binding fragments, and a loose parchment <locus from="[fragment_front]"
                                    to="[fragment_back]">fragment</locus> used as a bookmark in the volume. The volume contains primarily alchemical
                                and medical texts, written between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">This manuscript, like many others included in the Curious Cures in Cambridge Libraries project, was once

                                    <persName type="display">Roger Marchall (c. 1417-1477)</persName>

                                </name>, a doctor and physician to Edward IV who wrote his name on p. <locus from="8" to="8">8</locus>. In common with
                                numerous other manuscripts he owned and used, Marchall added a table of contents to the beginning of the manuscript
                                (p. <locus from="8" to="8">8</locus>) as well as rubrics and running headings for some of the treatises in the volume
                                (see e.g., p. <locus from="9" to="9">9</locus>). Marchall's ownership and use of manuscripts is very well-attested,
                                with forty-five surviving books (including this one) bearing evidence to connect him to them in some way, six others
                                with plausible Marchall connections, and a further twelve that are recorded but not traced.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">In March 2024, Dr James Freeman, Medieval Manuscripts Specialist at CUL observed that pp. <locus from="1"

                                178/211 and MS 181/214 leaves from the same legal manuscript have been inserted sideways and reused as flyleaves at
                                the beginning of a volume of scientific texts. In both MS 178/211 and MS 181/214, Marchall made use of the generous
                                marginal space common to legal manuscripts to record his name and a list of the contents of the respective volumes on
                                the last page of that group of endleaves (i.e., Gonville and Caius MS 181/214, p. <locus from="8" to="8">8</locus> and
                                Gonville and Caius MS 178/211, f. [iv] verso). Both volumes have been rebound since Marchall's death in 1477, but it
                                is plausible that each had a binding that resembled the other's in Marchall's lifetime as the shared endleaves, both
                                with Marchall annotations, suggest that they were both bound by the same workshop on Marchall's behalf. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">As described by Linda Voigts, the present manuscript is one of eighteen (possibly nineteen) manuscripts
                                at Gonville and Caius College that may be linked to Marchall, and which were probably donated by him to Gonville Hall
                                (as Gonville and Caius then was); King's College and Peterhouse, where the study of medicine was also supported,
                                received gifts of books from him too. Thirteen manuscripts owned or used by Marchall (and another with possible

                                        since Marchall's death in 1477, but it is plausible that each binding may have resembled the other's in
                                        Marchall's lifetime as the shared source of endleaves, both with Marchall annotations, suggest that they were
                                        both bound by the same workshop on Marchall's behalf. </p></note>

                                                legal text was ruled in two-column format with generous margins for annotations; the width of the
                                                outer bounds of the columns is c. 100mm. The later list of the contents of the volume by Marchall is
                                                placed in what was the lower margin of the legal text; the list of the contents is unruled, but makes
                                                use of some of the frame-ruling for the legal text. </seg></p>

                                    the first parchment quire belonging to this text with a larger section written on paper by a different scribe. </note>

                                <note>This is a short extract from a much longer poem discussed and edited in A. Timmerman, <hi rend="italic">Verse
                                        and Transmutation</hi>. The text in Gonville and Caius MS 181/214 does not appear to be a close match for
                                    other surviving versions of the poem as some of the lines are in a different order, and there are some lines of
                                    verse here that do not seem to exist in other copies of the poem. </note>
                                <note>There are two alchemical diagrams above the poem. </note>
