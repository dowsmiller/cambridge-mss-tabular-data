                                    <p>The accounts refer to persons situated in (in order of appearance) Lewis (<q>levys</q>), London
                                        (<q>london</q>), Nottinghamshire (<q>notynghamschyre</q>), Cardiff (<q>kerdyffe in Walys</q>),
                                        Henley-on-Thames (<q>henele uppon temse</q>), and Wycombe (<q>Wycombe</q>). They are typically named with
                                        their titles and occupations: <q>pryor</q>, <q>knyȝt</q>, <q>squyer</q>, <q>draper</q>, <q>mercer</q>,
                                            <q>grocer</q>, <q>habyrdasscher</q>, <q>brever</q>, <q>talov chavndeler</q>, <q>pevterer</q>, <q>dyer</q>,
                                            <q>ffyschemonger</q>, <q>wolpacker</q>, <q>taylour</q>, <q>tavyer</q>. While the aforementioned titles and
                                        roles all concern men, the accounts include two women: 1. a silkwoman (<q>sylkwoman</q>) who is only
                                        identified by her surname: <q>langeton</q>. There were (at least) three silkwomen with that surname: Jane
                                        Langton, a silkwoman and merchant in London, who drew up her will in 1475; and her two daughters-in-law Agnes
                                        Langton and Elizabeth Langton. The latter supplied the royal wardrobe with silk in 1503 [on them, see
                                            <bibl>Marian K. Dale, 'The London Silkwomen of the Fifteenth Century', <hi rend="italic">The Economic
                                                History Review</hi>, 4:3 (1933), 324-335 (pp. 327-328)</bibl>]. 2. A woman who is (again) only
                                        identified by her surname <q>Helmys of Henele uppon temse</q> and who is described as the executrix of <q>John
                                            Helmys merchant</q>. She has not been identified. </p>
                                    <p>The evidence for the dating of the accounts to 1463-64 comes from three entries: 1. An entry for <q>Thomas
                                            Cooke</q> who is identified as <q>knyȝt and aldyrman of london</q>. He must be Sir Thomas Cooke
                                        (c. 1410-1478), who was alderman of the City of London from 1456 onwards, knighted in 1465, and Lord Mayor in
                                        1462-63 (for him, see also <bibl subtype="internal" type="MS">Cambridge, Trinity College, MS O.3.11</bibl> and
                                            <bibl subtype="internal" type="MS">Cambridge, Trinity College, MS R.14.52</bibl>). 2. An entry that names
                                            <q>John</q> as the prior of Lewis Priory. Given the identification of Sir Thomas Cooke, this prior John
                                        cannot be John Burghersh, who was prior from 1409 until 1414, or John Ashdowne who occurs as prior in 1506. He
                                        can only be John Danyel, who was prior from 1445 until 1464. 3. The final entry that refers to John Frost,
                                        mercer, who drew up his will, which identifies William Dunthorn as his executor, dated to 2 July 1463 (see

                                    of London: possibly copied and/or owned part of this manuscript. As Gross (1996), p. 117 fn. 74 points out, the
                                    accounts on pp. <locus from="185" to="186">185-186</locus> contain an entry for Sir Thomas Cooke (c. 1410-1478),
                                    draper, knight, and Lord Mayor of London, who appears to have had a family connection with Frost although their
                                    exact relationship is unclear. In Frost's will of 1463-4 (see <bibl subtype="external" type="MS"><ref target="https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D969398">Kew, The National Archives, PROB
                                            11/5/211</ref></bibl>; ? proved on 9 April 1466), he bequeathed twenty shillings to a certain <q>Thomas
                                        Cooke my cousyn in Cambrigge if he þat tyme continue at scole to augmentacioun of lernyng</q>. The latter may
                                    be the son and namesake of Sir Thomas Cooke, who was born in 1452. The will suggests that Frost knew Sir Thomas
                                    Cooke through his sister, to whom he refers as <q>Isabell Cooke my suster</q>. However, no further information
                                    appears to be available on her marriage. The final entry on p. <locus from="186" to="186">186</locus> concerns a
                                    reference to William Dunthorn as the executor of John Frost's will, which is indeed confirmed by the
                                    aforementioned will.</p>

                                <note>This is one of two copies of a poem which imagines a dialogue between Albertus Magnus and Elchyȝell, the Queen
                                    of Elves, in which she teaches him a recipe with which mercury can be turned into silver and gold and silver
                                    turned into gold. The other copy can be found in <bibl subtype="external" type="MS"><ref target="">London, British

                                    16th-century grimoire, features descriptions and conjurations of the spirits <q>Oberyon</q> (I, pp. 76, 113,
                                    115-116, 185, 190-200); <q>Ascariell</q> [<q>Askariell</q>] (I, pp. 169-170); <q>Byleth</q> (I, pp. 78, 87); and
                                        <q>Sibilla</q> (II, p. 228). What is especially interesting is that the <hi rend="italic">Folger Book of
                                        Magic</hi>, identifies <q>Oberyon</q> [Oberon] as 'kinge of the fayries' who can reveal hidden treasure and
                                    how it can be obtained. His name in Cambridge, Trinity College, MS R.14.44 then resonates with the alchemical poem
                                    on <locus from="15v" to="18r">15r-17r</locus> in which Elchizel, Queen of Fairies, provides instructions on how to
