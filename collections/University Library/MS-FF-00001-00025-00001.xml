                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">This manuscript contains a late twelfth-century copy of the <hi rend="italic">Gesta pontificum
                                    Anglorum</hi> (<hi rend="italic">The deeds of the English bishops</hi>) by the monk and historian William of
                                Malmesbury (c. 1090-c. 1143). The text is an ecclesiastical history of England from the arrival of St Augustine in 597
                                up to the 1120s when the work was being written. William saw himself as the successor to Bede, and drew on both
                                Anglo-Saxon and Norman sources and traditions. For the period after the death of Bede in 730, William's account is
                                'the most important single source for the history of the English church' (Preest (2002), p. x). He used many of the
                                works which he copied and collected for the library of Malmesbury Abbey, but also travelled widely, including in the
                                text numerous topographical observations that he had gained at first-hand. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The text is arranged as a survey of the bishops and saints of all the dioceses of England. The first Book
                                covers Canterbury and Rochester, the second London, East Anglia and Wessex, the third York, Lindisfarne and Durham and
                                the fourth Mercia. The <hi rend="italic">Gesta pontificum Anglorum</hi> was popular with William's contemporaries and
                                19 medieval copies of it survive, including one written by William himself (<bibl subtype="external" type="MS"><ref target="https://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/objects/b18b9f25-baa4-4943-a641-5e184908a34d/">Oxford, Magdalen
                                        College, MS lat. 172</ref></bibl>). Although the work was completed in 1125, the numerous authorial
                                alterations and corrections to Magdalen MS lat. 172 show that William continued to revise the text over the next
                                decade or more, often removing the more scurrilous and potentially offensive comments about his contemporaries.
                                William also wrote a fifth Book, which recounted the history of his own abbey of Malmesbury. This survives in its
                                fullest form only in the autograph manuscript. One other medieval copy contains an abbreviated, probably not authorial
                                version - <bibl subtype="external" type="MS">London, British Library, Cotton MS Claudius A.v</bibl> - entitled therein
                                as a Life of St Aldhelm, who was the founder of Malmesbury Abbey. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The manuscript shown here was once in the possession of Matthew Parker (1504-1575), archbishop of
                                Canterbury. Parker was not only a collector of manuscripts: he also used them, annotating and cross-referencing,
                                rebinding and rearranging the books that he owned. Before donating this manuscript to Cambridge University Library in
                                1574 (along with 24 others), he augmented it with additional works by William and other chroniclers, including copies
                                that he commissioned himself, among them a copy of the fifth Book (for which, see <bibl subtype="internal" type="MS"><ref target="https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-FF-00001-00025-00002/1">MS Ff.1.25(2)</ref></bibl>). The text
                                of the <hi rend="italic">Gesta pontificum Anglorum</hi> was first edited in 1596, using this manuscript, by the
                                antiquarian and book collector <name key="person_v100218411" role="edt">

                                </name>. Savile elected not to include the fifth Book in his edition, despite its immediate availability. Although MS
                                Ff.1.25(1) is an early production, nevertheless as a distant copy of the autograph, the text's modern editors have
                                judged that it 'has no virtue apart from its age' (see Winterbottom and Thomson (2007), p. xxv).</seg>

                                    the presence formerly of four corner-bosses and a chain staple) indicates that the manuscript was previously bound
                                    in similar style to that of the binding on other manuscripts donated to the University Library by Matthew Parker
                                    (for an example, see: <ref target="https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-II-00002-00004/1">MS Ii.2.4</ref>). See

                                <p>This implies that the manuscript was bound in two volumes at this time. However, in the list of manuscripts donated
                                    by Parker to the University Library in 1574, the manuscript is described as containing 460 pages. Such statements
                                    of extent were given for each of Parker's donations and were also written onto one of the opening leaves of the
                                    manuscripts themselves (see here, f. <locus from="3r" to="3r">3r</locus>). None of the other manuscripts within
                                    the Ff.1.25 classmark contain such an inscription, and the total number of pages amounts to 460, by the Parkerian
                                    pagination (see Foliation for further details). </p>
                                <p>Furthermore, as described above, Parker's donations were (with the odd exception) bound in a consistent format, and
                                    where the manuscripts have been rebound since that time this evidence is often preserved within the new binding.
                                    In MS Ff.1.25(1), only the recycled endleaves at the front of the volume have been preserved. Only Ff.1.25(5)
                                    contains similar endleaves, and only at the rear; they are found in none of the other volumes. The material
                                    evidence thus points to the manuscripts that are now Ff.1.25(1)-(5) having arrived bound as a single volume.
                                    Furthermore, each of these volumes bear evidence of having had the author(s) and title(s) of their contents inked
                                    onto the fore-edges of their leaves, presumably by <name key="person_v66476673">

                                    the manuscript remained as a single volume in the mid-17th century. </p>
                                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">History</hi> of the University Library, David McKitterick recounts that the part of 
                                    this manuscript containing the <hi rend="italic">Historia regum Britanniae</hi> (now MS Ff.1.25(5)) was discovered 
                                    to be missing when the manuscripts in the Old Library were inspected in 1732 and again in 1748: the number '245'
                                    assigned by James in 1600 is in both lists, in the first with the partial title 'Galfrid: monumethensis etc'
                                    (see <bibl subtype="internal" type="MS"><ref target="">Cambridge, University Library, MS Add. 4451</ref></bibl>, ff. 18r and 19r).
                                    The implication is that by this stage Ff.1.25 had been rebound into two volumes. However, a more probable explanation
                                    is that James's assigning of two numbers to the manuscript misled the compilers of these lists of missing books,
                                    who were searching fruitlessly for Geoffrey of Monmouth and other texts bound into a discrete volume, when in 
                                    fact they remained in place in the same volume as what James has designated '244'.
                                    Indeed, that no mention is made in the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of manuscripts preserved in the Library of the University of Cambridge</hi>, vol. 2
                                    (1857) means that it is almost certain that it was not divided into separate volumes until 1862. </p>

                                            <item>This was in turn covered with a piece of parchment (shown here as f. <locus from="3a recto" to="3a verso">3a</locus>), onto which was copied a fresh title, complete with a historiated
                                                initial bearing Matthew Parker's coat of arms as archbishop of Canterbury.</item>
                                            <item>Parker's name - Matthaeus Cantuar. 1574 - was added after this piece of parchment was inserted, and
