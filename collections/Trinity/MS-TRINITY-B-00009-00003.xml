                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">This manuscript, probably produced during the 11th
                                century, is a <title>Menologion for December</title>, a liturgical
                                book containing the hagiographical texts to be read in church during
                                that month, including Lives of Saints, martyrdom narratives and
                                accounts regarding relics and posthumous miracles.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The texts in this volume are the work of Symeon
                                Metaphrastes, or Symeon the Metaphrast, a <date calendar="gregorian" notAfter="1000" notBefore="0900">10th-century</date> Byzantine
                                civil official and later a monk. He rewrote numerous existing
                                hagiographical texts in a more accessible style and compiled these
                                into a new <hi rend="italic">menologion</hi>. The term Metaphrast
                                refers to this practice of rewriting. Symeon's versions of these
                                stories became the most widely used, superseding those read
                                previously.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">At a later date, probably in the 12th century, four new
                                quires were added to replace original folios which had been lost,
                                one in the middle of the manuscript and the rest at the end (ff.
                                    <locus from="57v-58r" to="65v-66r">58-65</locus> and <locus from="112v-113r" to="136v-137r">113-136</locus>). These are
                                composed of parchment originally from other manuscripts, reused in
                                palimpsest by erasing and overwriting their former text. Remaining
                                traces indicate that at least some of this material came from Latin
                                musical manuscripts, as indicated by the red horizontal lines of
                                musical staves. Some of these folios have previously been identified
                                as having been reused from Greek manuscripts (Tchernetska, p. 734),
                                but the shadowy Greek minuscule script visible here appears to be
                                text showing through from the opposite face of the folio.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The replacement quires at the end of the manuscript are
                                followed by two more folios originally from a Latin manuscript,
                                probably a missal, rewritten in palimpsest with a new Greek text,
                                probably in the 13th century. However, they appear not to have been
                                rewritten for this manuscript but for another, and to have been
                                later reused in this manuscript as endleaves (<locus from="136v-137r" to="138v-[ii] recto">ff. 137r-138v</locus>).
                                Their text does not belong to the Menologion but to another type
                                liturgical book, a Menaion, containing various hymns, prayers and
                                readings particular to individual days of the church calendar. They
                                also appear to have been bound into this manuscript upside-down at
                                some point prior to its most recent rebinding, as indicated by the
                                placement of their early modern folio numbers, treatment which would
                                accord with their use as endleaves rather than an intended part of
                                the manuscript's content. Thus they seem to have formed part of at
                                least three different manuscripts in the course of their history,
                                and to have served different purposes in each.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The reuse of parchment from Latin manuscripts in a
                                Greek volume suggests that at the time the manuscript may have been
                                in use in a region where both literary cultures were present, such
                                as southern Italy. This possibility is reinforced by the fact that
                                the Latin undertext of the endleaves had been written in the
                                distinctive Beneventan style of script, suggesting that the
                                manuscript from which they came had been produced in southern Italy,
                                possibly in the 11th century.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">A sequence of quire signatures in Greek numerals
                                survives from an occasion when the manuscript was rebound, including
                                the number ten marked on <locus from="73v-74r" to="73v-74r">f.
                                    73v</locus>, at the end of a quire. The Greek numeral used for
                                this number is the letter <hi rend="italic">iota</hi>, which as a
                                single vertical stroke resembles the Arabic numeral 1, and what
                                appears to be a zero has been written alongside it, to create the
                                Arabic number 10. However, the number at the beginning of the same
                                quire is in the normal Greek form. The form of the signature at the
                                end of the quire could reflect rebinding in an environment where
                                both systems of numerals were in use, leading the binder either to
                                use one rather than the other out of absent-mindedness or to change
                                systems here deliberately in order to avoid mistakenly reading the
                                Greek number ten as an Arabic number one.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">If the manuscript did spend time in Italy, it was
                                subsequently taken to Greece, as it came into the possession of the
                                Monastery of the Pantokrator on Mount Athos, as indicated by a note
                                on <locus from="[i] verso-1r" to="[i] verso-1r">f. 1r</locus>. It
                                was bought from the monastery, along with many other manuscripts, by
                                the classicist Richard Bentley (1662-1742), Master of Trinity
                                College.</seg>

                            <origin>These folios come originally from a Latin manuscript, probably a
                                missal, which appears to have been written in the Beneventan style
                                of <placeName key="place_g">southern Italy</placeName> in the <date calendar="gregorian" notAfter="1099" notBefore="1000">11th
                                    century</date>, and were reused in palimpsest in a Greek
                                menaion, probably in the <date calendar="gregorian" notAfter="1299" notBefore="1200">13th century</date>, as suggested by the style
                                of script. Subsequently they were reused in the present manuscript
                                as endleaves.</origin>
