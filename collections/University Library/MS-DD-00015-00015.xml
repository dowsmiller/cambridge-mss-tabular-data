                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">This manuscript is a thirteenth-century compilation of moral guidance texts, the principal ones being:
                                the <hi rend="italic">Verbum abbreviatum</hi> of Petrus Cantor (d. 1197), with which the manuscript begins and which
                                occupies two thirds of the book as a whole (ff. <locus from="1r" to="153r">1r-153r</locus>); an abridged version of
                                the apocalyptic world history, <hi rend="italic">De initio et fine saeculi</hi>, which was purported to have been
                                written by Methodius, bishop of Patara (d. 311) but was actually composed originally in Syriac in the second half of
                                the 7th century (ff. <locus from="153v" to="161r">153v-161r</locus>); and, at the end of the manuscript, two texts of
                                doubtful authorship but attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153) (ff. <locus from="171r" to="218v"
                                    >171r-218v</locus>), plus various excerpts from his letters, sermons and other writings, accompanied by
                                interpolations from other authors such as Anselm of Canterbury and Augustine.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The author of the first text, Petrus Cantor, was a prominent theologian at the University of Paris during
                                the second half of the 12th century; the epithet attached to his name, Cantor (meaning 'the Chanter') refers to his
                                responsibilities for managing the choir and the conduct of liturgical servies, as the second highest-ranking member of
                                the cathedral chapter at Notre-Dame. Petrus was the first to compose lectures on every book of the Bible, and his
                                quaestiones were gathered and compiled into a <hi rend="italic">Summa de sacramentis</hi>. He is also known to have
                                preached widely, though few of his sermons now survive. It is perhaps as a consequence of this that he is credited
                                with being the first master at the University of Paris to use sermon exempla in the formal setting of his lectures on
                                the Bible: repurposing material more commonly used for preaching to the laity for teaching theology in an academic
                                context.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Such an approach, and its appeal to medieval readers and preachers, is illustrated by the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Verbum abbreviatum</hi>, which went on to enjoy a wide circulation: close to a hundred copies are
                                known to survive. Sometimes referred to as the <hi rend="italic">Libellus de viciis et virtutibus</hi> ('The little
                                book of vices and virtues'), Petrus's text relates instances of cautionary or edifying behaviour that are intended to
                                provide a practical guide for the reader's own life. The Bible, in particular the historical books of the Old
                                Testament, provides the source of many such exempla, but Petrus's text is remarkable for its heavy and extensive use
                                of classical works: more than half of the chapters contain classical citations or allusions of some form. The <hi
                                    rend="italic">Epistulae morales</hi> of Seneca were a prominent source, but also writings by Ovid, Horace,
                                Juvenal, Lucan, Virgil and others. As such, the <hi rend="italic">Verbum abbreviatum</hi> reflects broader
                                intellectual trends that were current in later 12th-century Paris - to understand contemporary life through the prism
                                of Christian ethics and consider practical matters in moral terms - developments in which Petrus Cantor played an
                                instrumental role.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">A complementary source of Biblical exempla was provided by the <hi rend="italic">De initio et fine
                                    saeculi</hi> of pseudo-Methodius. It was read in England principally as a source for the study of Old Testament
                                history and was frequently cited (often at second-hand, via Peter Comestor's <hi rend="italic">Historia
                                    scholastica</hi>) in such texts as the <hi rend="italic">Chronica maiora</hi> of Matthew Paris, the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Flores historiarum</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Polychronicon</hi> of Ranulph Higden. It was in
                                the abridged version preserved here that English readers encountered pseudo-Methodius: all surviving copies but one
                                that were made in England preserved this shortened text (see D'Evelyn (1918) and Twomey (2007)). It therefore chimes
                                with Petrus Cantor's introduction to the <hi rend="italic">Verbum abbreviatum</hi>, in which he explained the need to
                                abbreviate the Scriptures in order (as Eva Matthews Sanford put it) 'to save the time and trouble of copying, reading,
                                emending and even of carrying the ponderous tomes that contained the complete Bible and its glosses...'.</seg>
                            <seg> Similar moral guidance is provided by the other thirteenth-century contents of the volume. The latter part of the
                                manuscript comprises a cluster of texts that are assigned in the rubrics to Bernard of Clairvaux (see ff. <locus
                                    from="171r" to="171r">171r</locus>, <locus from="171v" to="171v">171v</locus>, <locus from="201v" to="201v">
                                    201v</locus>). In the case of the main text in this section, the <hi rend="italic">Meditationes piissimae de
                                    cognitione humanae conditionis</hi> (ff. <locus from="171v" to="201v"> 171-201v</locus>), this attribution is
                                apocryphal; it is thought instead that the author was an anonymous Franciscan. The text emphasises inward reflection
                                and prayer as the path to self-knowledge and thereby to God and, like the <hi rend="italic">Verbum abbreviatum</hi>,
                                it gained wide circulation in the medieval period. The preface that accompanies it in this manuscript was not part of
                                this pseudonymous text, but rather derives from the <hi rend="italic">Meditationes</hi> of Anselm of Canterbury.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Similarly, after the conclusion of the <hi rend="italic">Meditationes piissimae</hi> of pseudo-Bernard,
                                there is a brief extract of the first four chapters from the <hi rend="italic">Liber exhortationis</hi> of Patriarch
                                Paulinus of Aquileia (c. 750-802). The <hi rend="italic">Liber exhortationis</hi> drew heavily on the <hi
                                    rend="italic">De admonitio ad filium spiritualem</hi> of pseudo-Basil, a guide perhaps written to advise monks
                                about to enter religious orders. Urging its reader to develop virtues and eschew vice, it formed an obvious
                                accompaniment to the <hi rend="italic">Verbum abbreviatum</hi>. The closing part of the volume comprises a series of
                                short extracts principally from the works of Bernard of Clairvaux and Augustine (plus others whose source has not
                                presently been identified).</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Minor variations in the preparation of the page both within and between these thirteenth-century parts
                                point to the manuscript having been copied in stages (further emendations and additions were made in the fourteenth
                                and fifteenth centuries - for further details of which, see below). The first three quires of the book (in its
                                original form, but now Quires 3-5, ff. <locus from="1r" to="24v">1r-24v</locus>) were ruled for 21 lines per page and
                                pricking marks are visible along the edge of the fore-edge margin; those that followed (Quires 6-19, ff. <locus
                                    from="25r" to="166v">25r-166v</locus>) were ruled for 23 lines per page, and no pricking marks are visible
                                (suggesting that either pricking was not used, or that they were placed closer to the edge of the quires and therefore
                                were trimmed away when the manuscript was bound). There is also a change in quire structure: from gatherings of eight
                                leaves in the first group (Quires 3-5) to one gathering of twelve leaves (Quire 6) and thirteen gatherings of ten
                                leaves in the second group (Quires 7-19). In turn, these contrast with the latter part of the manuscript (ff. <locus
                                    from="171r" to="218v">171r-218v</locus>), which is formed entirely of quires of eight leaves, ruled for 22 lines
                                of text, with pricking marks along the edge of the fore-edge margin.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The thematic and intellectual coherence of their contents, however, indicates that the production of
                                these portions was closely contemporaneous and that they were intended to be bound together. That this occured at an
                                early stage - probably from the outset and certainly prior to the fourteenth century - is confirmed by the remarkable
                                survival of painted decoration along all three <locus from="upper edge" to="fore-edge">edges of the leaves</locus>.
                                While medieval bindings might be rare, decorated edges are rarer still, since a manuscript's leaves were often trimmed
                                at the point of rebinding. MS Dd.15.15 preserves a notably ornate example along all three exposed edges, comprising
                                circular or heart-shaped designs formed of interwoven vines and containing elaborate foliate decoration, executed
                                primarily in red and blue ink. Another element of a medieval binding is also preserved: woven endbands at the top and
                                bottom of the spine, and formed of three threads, two of which were dyed, one in red and one in blue.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The manuscript went through a number of further changes during the course of its medieval existence,
                                alterations that shed light on the likely function that the book fulfilled for its owners. The first of these occurred
                                around the mid-fourteenth century and involved the erasure of a text previously written after the end of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">De initio et fine saeculi</hi> and the insertion in its place of a copy of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Rule of St Augustine</hi>. One can still see traces of this under-text, most obviously where its replacement does
                                not cover the whole line (as on ff. <locus from="162v" to="162v">162v</locus> and <locus from="163v" to="163v"
                                    >163v</locus>) and in the margins where decorated initials had previously marked textual divisions (as on ff.
                                    <locus from="161v" to="161v">161v</locus> and <locus from="163r" to="163r">163r</locus>). There also appears to
                                have been musical notation written on staves ruled in the fore-edge margin of f. <locus from="163r" to="163r"
                                    >163r</locus>. (Multi-spectral imaging of these leaves might help to shed further light on the manuscript's
                                history and use by revealing what this under-text was). Since there was not sufficient space in Quire 19 to
                                accommodate the entirety of the <hi rend="italic">Rule of St Augustine</hi>, leaves must have been inserted after this
                                point, though apparently without the manuscript being rebound. This might explain the subsequent loss of these
                                additional leaves. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">To rectify this deficiency, in the fifteenth century a later owner had a quire of four paper leaves added
                                to the manuscript (<locus from="167r" to="170v">Quire 20</locus>) and the remainder of the text copied therein. The
                                painting of the edges of the manuscript must pre-date this intervention, since no pigment is to be found along the
                                edges of these paper leaves. A further quire of four paper leaves (<locus from="i recto" to="iii verso">Quire
                                    1</locus>) was also added to the front of the volume, and a table of contents for the <hi rend="italic">Verbum
                                    abbreviatum</hi> copied onto it: the entries refer to the capitular rubrics in the text, with references given by
                                folio numbers, which were also inserted into that part of the volume at this stage. The paper used for both is drawn
                                from the same stock, however slight differences in preparation suggest that these two interventions were made
                                separately from one another: Quire 1 is smaller in size, was pricked with the point of a flat blade in both the gutter
                                and fore-edge margins, and its lines ruled in hardpoint; Quire 20 was pricked with the point of a rounded implement in
                                the fore-edge margin only, and the lines ruled in plummet (most visible on f. <locus from="169v" to="169v"
                                    >169v</locus>). It cannot be established conclusively that these additions were copied by the same hand: there are
                                some similarities between the two, though that responsible for the table of contents is somewhat neater and more
                                controlled.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Although there is no evidence for the manuscript's medieval provenance until the fifteenth century (and
                                probably the latter half at that), inferences might be drawn about its ownership and use from the combination of texts
                                that it contains and from its material characteristics. This is a small, highly portable volume, measuring merely 120
                                x 85mm, and must therefore have been intended for personal, perhaps private use. This chimes with the instructional
                                nature of much of its contents: texts which furnished the reader with models from the Bible, literature or history,
                                from which moral lessons might be drawn for his own life. There is evidence, furthermore, to suggest that the volume
                                was originally made for and used by a member of the religious orders. Besides the inclusion of excerpts from the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Liber exhortationis</hi>, the extracts from the letters and sermons of Bernard of Clairvaux found at
                                the end of the volume all concern aspects of monastic life and discipline. The same set of excerpts, in the same order

                            <seg type="para">The later addition of the <hi rend="italic">Rule of St Augustine</hi> points more explicitly to
                                readership within the context of a religious order - though not necessarily that of the Augustinian canons: the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Rule</hi> was also used also as a guide by members of the mendicant orders, by the Dominican and
                                Austin friars, as well as the Premonstratensian canons. Nevertheless, it raises the possibility - which later
                                additions to the manuscript appear to confirm - that this volume fulfilled a practical as well as a personal purpose.
                                Members of these orders played a role in the provision of pastoral care in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century England,
                                in particular by preaching to the laity. The texts in this volume would have furnished such a reader with a
                                conveniently arranged stock of exempla drawn from a variety of sources, which could then be extracted and deployed in
                                public sermons. The insertion of a table of contents and folio numbers in the fifteenth century further facilitated
                                the reference use of this manuscript. That care was taken to repair the deficient text of the <hi rend="italic">Rule
                                    of St Augustine</hi> points to this being continued to be of relevance to the book's readers and is thus
                                suggestive of its possession and use in the context of a secular or mendicant order into the fifteenth century.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The only evidence for the manuscript's medieval provenance is found on the front pastedown, where a
                                fifteenth-century ownership inscription names a 'magistro...Ricardo Wallour...presbitero'. This may be the same
                                Richard Wallour/Waller recorded as chaplain in the chantry of Robert Thorpe of Ashwellthorpe and whose will, dated
                                1506, is preserved at Norfolk Record Office (NCC will register Ryze 305), though this cannot presently be confirmed.
                                Wallour's description of himself as 'presbitero', however, not only raises the interesting possibility of this
                                manuscript's ownership passing from a member of a religious order to a secular priest, but would also appear to
                                exclude him from consideration as the person responsible for the restoration of the text of the Rule of St Augustine
                                in the manuscript.</seg>

                                    <p>The manuscript comprises 26 quires, the majority gatherings of 10 leaves (Quires 7-19) or 8 leaves (Quires
                                        21-26). Quires 1 and 20 were added in the 15th century. Quire 2 comprises two leaves, but they do not
                                        obviously form a bifolium; f. iv may once have been conjoint with what is now the front pastedown - both the
                                        front pastedown and f. iv recto are hair-sides - but the addition of Quire 1 means that the structure of Quire
                                        2 remains uncertain. The manuscript has previously been collated, with quire numbers written in pencil in the
                                        lower right-hand corner, starting at '1' on Quire 3. Folio numbers were written, apparently around the same
                                        time, on the first leaf of the second half of each quire. The tightness of the binding means that the
                                        following collation formulae are reliant on these earlier notations. <list>
