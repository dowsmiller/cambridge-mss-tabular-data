                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">This manuscript is a composite made up of parts copied
                                at dates between the early 16th century and 1690 and subsequently
                                bound together. It contains a varied <title>Greek Miscellany</title>
                                of texts including works on ecclesiastical organisation and history,
                                canon law, chronicles, the monuments of Constantinople and
                                recipes.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The oldest part of the manuscript is brief, containing
                                two letters written by a man named Andronikos to one Demetrios, on
                                paper whose watermarks place it in the first half of the 16th
                                century. One of these letters heaps praise on the city of Venice in
                                tones that suggest that writer and recipient may have belonged to
                                the Greek community of Venice or one of its overseas
                                territories.</seg>
                            <seg>Most of the older parts of the manuscript were copied by Ioannes
                                Malaxos, a prolific scribe and probably a monk, who worked in
                                Constantinople in the second half of the 16th century. He may well
                                have been related to two contemporary scribes originally from
                                Nauplion in the Peloponnese, Manuel and Nikolaos Malaxos. He
                                collaborated on occasion with Manuel after the latter moved to
                                Constantinople, and both of them worked with another Naupliot scribe
                                in the city, Theodosios Zygomalas.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Malaxos himself is believed to have composed various
                                texts in the manuscript relating to the historic buildings and
                                monuments of Constantinople and its environs, including descriptions
                                of the city gates and of the church of the Pammakaristos, at that
                                time the seat of the Patriarch of Constantinople, and its funerary
                                monuments. Besides those from the tombs of the Pammakaristos,
                                inscriptions transcribed by Malaxos included one from the walls of
                                Chalkedon, across the Bosphoros, and another bearing a Novel (law)
                                of the Emperor Manuel I, then at the Pammakaristos but transferred
                                in 1567 to the mausoleum being prepared for the reigning Sultan
                                Suleiman II. Other texts copied by Malaxos include short chronicles
                                and chronological lists of office-holders, lists of ecclesiastical
                                offices and recipes for products including medicines, inks and
                                soap.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The material on the Pammakaristos enables the
                                completion of the component of the manuscript in which it appears to
                                be placed between 1572 and 1587. The former year is the last in
                                which a son of the voivod Alexander of Moldavia, whose tomb is
                                mentioned here, is known to have been alive; the latter is the year
                                in which the Pammakaristos, described here as the patriarchal church
                                was seized by the Ottoman government, prior to being turned into a
                                mosque (Burke, 'Studi su copisti', p.230). There are two physically
                                distinct portions of the manuscript copied by Malaxos, which may be
                                of different dates. The other must date from later than 1566, since
                                Malaxos added an entry to the end of a short chronicle he had
                                copied, recording the accession in that year of the Ottoman Sultan
                                Selim II. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The later component parts of the manuscript were copied
                                by the Scottish scholar and long-serving royal librarian Patrick
                                Young (1584-1652), during the decade or so before his death. The
                                texts he copied here are mainly of canon law. He also added a
                                substitute folio to replace one originally coped by Malaxos, which
                                had been lost. This is one of many Greek manuscripts variously
                                owned, copied, commissioned and annotated by Young. The items copied
                                by him here are mainly canon law texts and lists of ecclesiastical
                                offices from the Byzantine era.</seg>
