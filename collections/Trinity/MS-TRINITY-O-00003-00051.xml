                     <seg part="N" type="para">This manuscript, the greater part of which was
                        completed in 1543 and the rest added shortly afterwards, contains a variety
                        of different texts. <title>Chronicles</title> and other works and extracts
                        bearing on chronology form the bulk of the collection.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">The main body of the manuscript consists of an
                        anonymous Byzantine world chronicle, charting history from the creation of
                        the world until the deposition in 1081 of the Emperor <name full="yes" instant="false" key="person_v307439442" type="person">

                        </name>. The text is structured largely by the reigns of rulers, and was
                        commonly divided, as here, into two sections, the first extending as far as
                        the reign of the Emperor <name full="yes" instant="false" key="person_v70259756" type="person">
                           <persName full="yes" instant="false" type="display">Diocletian

                        </name>, and the second containing the era of the Christian emperors.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">In the usual manner of Byzantine chronicles, it draws
                        heavily on earlier works in the same genre, the bulk of it being derived
                        from the chronicles of Theophanes (completed between 813 and 818) and
                        Constantine Manasses (between 1145 and 1150). The date of composition of
                        this chronicle is unknown. All of the considerable number of known
                        manuscripts date from the 15th century or later, leaving a large potential
                        range of dates between the composition of the work of Manasses and the
                        earliest evidence of its own existence. It provided in turn a source for
                        later chroniclers, being used in the composition of the anonymous text known
                        as the Chronicle of 1570.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">The second part of the manuscript, which contains
                        this chronicle, was copied by an anomymous scribe, who supplied a colophon
                        dating its completion to 1 April 1543 (<locus from="2:265v" to="2:265v">Part
                           II, f. 265v</locus>). The first part contains a contents list to this
                        text, and the third an array of shorter texts. Both have been identified as
                        the work of another hand, that of the prolific scribe Manuel Malaxos,
                        originally from <placeName full="yes" instant="false" key="place_g7011013">Nauplion</placeName>, who would later work in <placeName full="yes" instant="false" key="place_g7029383">Thebes</placeName>,
                           <placeName full="yes" instant="false" key="place_g7002473">Constantinople</placeName> and <placeName full="yes" instant="false" key="place_g1000080">Italy</placeName>, as a notary and teacher as
                        well as a copyist. The use of the same paper and the presence of the same
                        style of ornament in the parts of the manuscript he copied as in those
                        produced by the other hand indicates that they must have been added not long
                        after its completion and in the same context, placing this project early in
                        the career of Malaxos, who was active until at least 1581. However, each
                        part bears a separate early foliation sequence, probably dating to the time
                        of production and suggesting that the second part had been produced and
                        foliated before it was decided that a contents list should precede it. The
                        numbering of the quire signatures in the second part also starts from
                        scratch. Hence it appears likely that the additions by Malaxos were not part
                        of the original production plan.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">The shorter texts copied by Malaxos in the third part
                        include a text on the degrees of family relationship within which marriages
                        were prohibited, and a selection of letters, mainly by Flavius Philostratus,
                        a sophist of the early Roman Empire, and the 7th-century historian
                        Theophylact Simocatta. However, for the most part they conformed to the same
                        preoccupations of chronicling and chronology, including lists of
                        ecclesiastical office-holders, excerpts on matters of historical chronology
                        and short chronicles. One of these (<locus from="3:5r" to="3:6v">Part III,
                           ff. 5r-6v, line 5</locus>), although directly following a chronicle
                        finishing with the reign of <name full="yes" instant="false" key="person_v89403998" type="person">

                        </name>, is explicitly a continuation of a text extending as far as the
                        reign of Nikephoros III, possibly the much fuller world chronicle forming
                        the greater part of this manuscript, athough this was not the only Byzantine
                        chronicle to end at that point.</seg>
                     <seg part="N" type="para">The most significant of these texts is a short
                        chronicle which is in part unique to this manuscript. The first part of this
                        text is an unusual variant of the brief chronicle of Nikephoros I, Patriarch
                        of Constantinople in the early 9th century, expanded with additional
                        content. This proceeds seamlessly into a continuation which runs until <date calendar="gregorian" instant="false" when="1403">1403</date>. For the
                        most part the continuation is a brief, summary narration, but in its last
                        few years, during which it is primarily concerned with the activities of the

                        information not found elsewhere. This portion is evidently of closely
                        contemporary composition, but is not known to have survived in any other
                        manuscript.</seg>
