A hand of similar date has added an interlinear modern English gloss to those two texts on fols 5r-7r Graham suggests that this gloss probably served as a model for the gloss accompanying the edition of the prose and metrical prefaces included in Matthew Parker's 1574 edition of Asser's life of King Alfred, Ælfredi regis res gestae (Graham 1995:633-34).Graham notes the name 'Johannes Parker' in red crayon in the top right-hand corner of fol. 5r, probably in Matthew Parker's hand (Graham 1995:636-37). He suggests that the archbishop wrote the names of his two sons in several of his volumes, probably indicating which of them should inherit it. One of his other copies of the Pastoral Care (Trinity R.5.22) is inscribed 'Matthaeus Parker'.Other 16th-century additions include the underlining of two lines in red crayon on fol. 146v and the addition of the word finis at the foot of the same page.The text on the 16th-century flyleaf, fol. 150v, and readable from the offset on fol. 151r, is a document in Latin from Richard Lyell, Doctor of Law and vicar-general to Thomas Thirlby, Bishop of Westminster concerning a matrimonial case.

_addition_3,manuscript_1,,,,manuscript,,MS-LL-00005-00018,"The scribe also employs the corrective methods of insertion and superscription. On f. 6v there is an example of the word ‘white’ being added by means of a circumflex between letters. More commonly, however, the scribe simply superscripts the missing letter over the place of omission (e.g. senato˹r˺es on f. 25r). Due to the scribe’s application of superscription both when correcting and abbreviating words, it is occasionally unclear which task is in action. This is particularly true where only one letter is superscripted when there has been an omission of several letters, as is the case on f. 26r where the scribe writes: ‘dist˹o˺ye’. The word fits best semantically as ‘dist(r)˹o˺ye’, however the superscription does not clearly denote this and is not a common abbreviation notation for ‘ro’. It could thus be equally viewed to serve as an idiosyncratic abbreviation or to fulfil a corrective function. This is particularly so given that two words later ‘torment’ is represented as ‘to˹r˺ment’ where one or both functions are in operation simultaneously. In this instance, the word is not shortened in terms of the number of letters that appear if the superscript ‘r’ is viewed as an abbreviation, it does however abbreviate in the sense that it condenses the physical length of the word on the page.",f. 6v; f. 25r; f. 26r,6v 25r 26r,6v 25r 26r,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The material that has been covered is inverted and consists of three lines of writing and a signature. The writing fragment has been cut through to form the correct dimensions for the quarto. The paper that has been used to cover this is also scrap material being re-utilised, with writing covering its entirety and truncated by trimming on its outer and bottom edges. This suggests that the strip was cut specifically to fit the space it was required to cover. F. 29r appears mid-quire, however it marks the beginning of the excerpt taken from Augustine, which finishes well in advance of the material that required covering. The writing that follows the excerpt is a Latin couplet, with a matching (in both hand and form) Latin couplet occurring adjacently, and then a short piece of Latin writing in a separate hand and ink. The latter piece of writing, written in a seventeenth century hand, flows directly from the original page and onto the paste-over.",f. 29r; F. 29r,29 pasteover (r) 29r,29 pasteover (v) 29v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

_addition_1,manuscript_12138,,,,manuscript,,MS-ADD-06594,"The tables of the kephalaia preceding the Gospels underwent notable accidents; the table to Matthew and the second half of the table to Mark from kephalaion 30 are now missing (due to the loss of f. 80). Moreover, an important number of discrepancies can be observed between the table of the kephalaia as presented before the Gospel of Luke (f. 137v) and the kephalaia headings found within the text of that Gospel. It appears that, in the table, the rubricator made some mistakes when writing the kephalaia numbers before the corresponding kephalaia titles previously written by the main scribe. Considering wrongly a line break as the start of a new kephalaion title, he attributed a new number to a line of text which turns out to be only the end of the title beginning in the previous line. In particular, the table erroneously considers […] τὴν κληρονομίαν as a new kephalaion title and gives it the number “46”, whereas it is only a part of section 45 (the actual section 46 being Περὶ οὗ εὐφόρησεν ἡ χώρα πλουσίου). From kephalaion 46 onwards, the numbering within table is consequently one number ahead of the headings present in the text. That gap remains until the rubricator makes the converse mistake, when he forgets to give a number to kephalaion 79 (ἐξουθένησις Ἡρώδου). That is why, from kephalaion 80 until the last one, kephalaion 83, the numberings of both the table and the text coincide once again. Furthermore, a mistake (this time made by the main scribe) is found in the kephalaia titles of the same table: kephalaion 58 (περὶ τοῦ οἰκονόμου τῆς ἀδικίας) was inadvertedly copied twice; once at its expected place, and a second time after kephalaion 59, Περὶ τοῦ πλουσίου καὶ τοῦ Λαζάρου, but without altering the numbering.",137v,137v,137v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
_addition_2,manuscript_12138,,,,manuscript,,MS-ADD-06594,"The lection notes are easily recognisable, being written in a small red-ink uncial. A lection note is generally composed of an indication on the time of the year the lesson is to be read, and a very brief sentence summarising its content. Within the body of the text, the extent of the passage to be read is delimited with the abbreviated forms of the words ἀρχή (""start"") and τέλος (""end""). Three main sorts of rubricated lection notes can be distinguished: ones intended for the Saturday and Sunday lessons (the σαββατοκυριακαί lessons), which are respectively indicated σαβ. and κυρ.; ones for the 5 week days (the καθημεριναί lessons), which all start with an indication of the week and day the lesson is read; and finally ones intended for specific religious feasts, which are generally indicated with the name of the concerned feast. An important number of the lessons present in the margins of the Codex Macedoniensis coincide with those used in the traditional menologia, that is to say, the second section found in Byzantine lectionaries which supplied a Gospel reading for each day of the year. As in our manuscript, the menologia start the liturgical year on the 1st of September and end it on the 30th of August.
