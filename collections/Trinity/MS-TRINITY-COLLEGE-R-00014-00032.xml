                        <summary>
                            <seg type="para">Cambridge, Trinity College, MS R.14.32 is a medical compendium, made partly of parchment (ff. 1-66) and
                                partly of paper (ff. 67-173), and was produced in England in the second half of the 15th century. The paper comes from
                                the same stock, except for the last two quires (ff. 151-173; see Part 2), which are of a visibly different
                                consistency. A single scribe copied the larger part of the texts in a mixed hand with elements of Anglicana and
                                Secretary scripts (see Part 1), however other hands' interventions can be observed in this section of the manuscript
                                (notably, a change of hand occurs at f. <locus from="76r" to="76r">76r</locus> in the middle of the 'Tractatus de
                                urinis'). Part 2 contains a witness of the Latin herbal known as <hi rend="italic">Circa instans</hi>, copied by a
                                scribe not involved in the compilation of the previous texts. It is thus likely that originally these two quires had
                                been a separate booklet and were added to the rest of the book at a later date. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">MS R.14.32 contains exclusively medical texts of different genres, from theoretical treatises to herbals
                                and recipes, which are for the most part Middle English translations of Latin originals. Along with the vernacular
                                writings, the manuscript includes a collection of thirteen medical recipes in Latin (ff. <locus from="140r" to="144r"
                                    >140r-144r</locus>) and the aforementioned <hi rend="italic">Circa instans</hi> (ff. <locus from="151r" to="168r"
                                    >151r-168r</locus>). Many of the texts in MS R.14.32 were largely widespread in the late Middle Ages, however the
                                forms in which they occur in this manuscript sometimes deviate from the textual tradition. For example, the herbal on
                                ff. 1v-65r, which has been traditionally identified with a witness of the Middle English <hi rend="italic">Agnus
                                    Castus</hi> is in fact an original compilation derived from the <hi rend="italic">Agnus Castus</hi>, the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Circa instans</hi>, and other sources still to be identified. Among the entries of the herbal some
                                spaces have been left blank, probably to add other plants' descriptions or botanical drawings.</seg>
                            <seg type="para">Under the rubric 'Tractatus de urinis' (ff. <locus from="67r" to="80v">67r-80v</locus>), various texts on
                                urines have been joined together to form a cohesive unity, very similar to the texts found in <bibl type="MS"
                                    subtype="external"><ref target="">London, British Library, MS Sloane 121</ref></bibl> and <bibl type="MS"
                                    subtype="external"><ref target="">London, British Library, MS Sloane 706</ref></bibl>. The 'Tractatus de urinis'
                                is followed by a small compendium made of nine texts, recorded in MS Sloane 706 and <bibl><ref

                                    Q.D.1</ref></bibl> as well. The compendium begins with an abridged Middle English translation of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Letter of Ipocras</hi> merged with a dietary regimen (ff. <locus from="81r" to="82r"
                                >81r-82r</locus>), and continues with treatises on the body parts where ailments arise (ff. <locus from="82v" to="83r"
                                    >82v-83r</locus>), the heartbeat (ff. <locus from="83r" to="85v">83r-85v</locus>), the leaves of sage (f. <locus
                                    from="85v" to="85v">85v</locus>), bloodletting (ff. <locus from="86r" to="88r">86r-88r</locus>), the influence of
                                planets on men's complexions (ff. <locus from="88r" to="88v">88r-88v</locus>), the four humours (ff. <locus from="88v"
                                    to="89r">88v-89r</locus>), and on the number of bones, veins and teeth in human body (f. <locus from="89v"
                                    to="89v">89v</locus>), and finally the four-chapters version of the Middle English translation of John of
                                Burgundy's treatise on the plague (ff. <locus from="90r" to="92r">90r-92r</locus>). Other texts include a treatise on
                                the medical properties of distilled waters (ff. <locus from="93r" to="93v">93r-93v</locus>) and a fragmentary Middle
                                English translation of the <hi rend="italic">Circa instans</hi> (ff. <locus from="128r" to="129v">128r-129v</locus>).
                                There are also excerpts from the Middle English version of Geoffrey of Vinsauf's commentary on Palladius, known as the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Book of Trees and Wine</hi> (ff. <locus from="130r" to="130v">130r-130v</locus>), and relatedly
                                from the <hi rend="italic">Craft of Grafting</hi> by Nicolas Bollard (f. <locus from="131r" to="131r">131r</locus>), a
                                herbal in verse (ff. <locus from="134v" to="139v">134v-139v</locus> and <locus from="144v" to="146v"
                                >144v-146v</locus>), and a verse treatise on rosemary (ff. <locus from="147r" to="148r">147r-148r</locus>).</seg>
                            <seg type="para">The corpus of medieval medical recipes displayed in MS R.14.32 is substantial: there are 288 such texts
                                in total, all but a few of which are gathered in thematically organized collections (for example, the receptarium
                                known as <hi rend="italic">The Alchemical Waters of Saint Giles</hi> on ff. <locus from="96r" to="99r"
                                >96r-99r</locus>) or arranged according to the traditional head-to-foot order. The others were included as standalone
                                items, such as the recipe for a well-known oral anaesthetic known as 'dwale' on f. <locus from="92v" to="92v"
                                    >92v</locus>, or added to blank spaces within or at the end of these by 15th- and 16th-century hands (see, for
                                example, ff. <locus from="94r" to="95r">94r-95r</locus>, <locus from="103v" to="103v">103v</locus>, <locus from="117r"
                                    to="117r">117r</locus>, <locus from="119v" to="119v">119v</locus>, <locus from="124v" to="124v">124v</locus>,
                                    <locus from="148v" to="148v">148v</locus>, <locus from="168v" to="169r">168v-169r</locus>). Two charms are also
                                included: one to staunch blood (f. <locus from="132r" to="132r">132r</locus>), crossed out by a later hand (probably
                                of an early modern owner of the manuscript), and one 'Pro Spasmo' (f. <locus from="134r" to="134r">134r</locus>),
                                written in a pale, faded shade of ink. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">Little is known about the history of this compendium. The addition of recipes just mentioned, or
                                supplementary entries to the <hi rend="italic">Agnus Castus</hi>-derived herbal (e.g. on f. <locus from="36r" to="36r"
                                    >36r</locus>), and other occasional miscellaneous annotations (ff. <locus from="92r" to="92r">92r</locus>, <locus
                                    from="169r" to="173v">169r-173v</locus>) are the only evidence of medieval use, and the manuscript contains no
                                information as to the identity of its owners at that time. Further additions by sixteenth-century hands testify to its
                                continued use in the early modern period and more specifically - given that most of these were remedies - a prolonged
                                interest in medical practice. One of these, 'For the yellow jaundice', concludes with the inscription 'M[agister] R
                                Arche a[nno] d[omi]ni 1548', which might be the name of the author of this addition (and others preceding it, which
                                were written in a closely similar script) or the person from whom this particular recipe was obtained. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The lack of evidence of medieval ownership notwithstanding, MS R.14.32 is a fascinating example of what
                                is often described as a 'leechbook', a compendium of both theoretical medical texts as well as recipes, which
                                practitioners of the healing arts might have used as a reference and commonplace book during their practice. The use
                                of a single paper stock (aside from the later addition), the adoption of consistent layouts in the presentation of the
                                texts, and their apparently purposeful arrangement in a sequence starting with general topics and concluding with
                                specific remedies, suggests that the book was conceived as a whole from the outset by its owner-compiler, with empty
                                spaces left deliberately in order to accommodate further additions as new medical remedies became known. </seg>
