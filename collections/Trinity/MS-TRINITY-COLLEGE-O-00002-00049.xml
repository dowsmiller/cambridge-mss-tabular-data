                            <seg type="para">The principal contents of this manuscript are the writings of the English surgeon John Arderne
                                (1307/08-c. 1380). He wrote in Latin and the writings seem to date from c. 1370 to 1376. Four separate Middle English
                                translations of his works made in the 15th century are also extant but Latin manuscripts are more commonly found (more
                                than 40) before 1500, making Arderne one of the most popular medieval medical authors in England (see <bibl type="MS"
                                    subtype="external"><ref target="https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-GONVILLE-AND-CAIUS-00190-00223/15">Cambridge,
                                        Gonville and Caius MS 190/223</ref></bibl>, ff. 7r-, for another Arderne manuscript). Arderne's writings
                                usually take up the greater part of these Latin manuscripts, although not always in the same order. The best known of
                                his works is the <hi rend="italic">Practica</hi> of fistula in ano, a treatise on different forms of operation to
                                treat fistulae and similar ailments affecting the backside and male genitals. In Trinity MS O.2.49 this work is found
                                on ff. <locus from="35r" to="59r">35r-59r</locus>. Another identifiable Arderne text is called <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Extracta emoroidarum</hi> ('Extracts on haemorrhoids', drawn from authors and texts listed at the start), and in
                                this manuscript the text runs from f. <locus from="63r" to="63r">63r</locus> to f. <locus from="73r" to="73r"
                                    >73r</locus>. Other texts are harder to identify clearly, though there are extended passages on administering
                                enemas, on eye diseases, and on ailments of the womb, for example. It has been convenient since the early 20th-century
                                studies of D'Arcy Power to characterise these as belonging to a <hi rend="italic">Liber medicinarum sive receptorum
                                    liber medicinalium</hi> ('Book of medicines or book of medical recipes'), though this is not a title found in
                                Arderne's writings. Power's title does convey that most of what is found on ff. 1r-35r, 59r-63r, and 73r-82r consists
                                of the medicinal virtues of herbs, compound medicines and recipes for a variety of ailments, not all of them surgical.
                                Many other recipes of the same kind are also to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Practica</hi> and in the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Extracta emoroidarum</hi>. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">There are charms and rituals interspersed with Arderne's recipes, as for example on f. <locus from="1r"
                                    to="1r">1r</locus>, where an <hi rend="italic">experimentum</hi> to stop the flow of blood is a ritual using a
                                split hazel rod. Some recipes, probably not authored by Arderne, are written in Middle English (see f. 1r again). Case
                                histories of treatment are found scattered amongst Arderne's recipes and sometimes his patients are named
                                (particularly in the <hi rend="italic">Practica</hi>). Arderne manuscripts are usually accompanied by a programme of
                                images in the margins of the text and this is true of Trinity MS O.2.49. In some deluxe manuscripts these are
                                illuminated, but not here, where the images are hand drawn by the scribe. The subjects include herbs, injuries,
                                bandages and instruments, and these images are often referred to by Arderne within the text. There are also diagrams
                                of winds and humours, and a crude Zodiac Man preceded by a table of lunar days and zodiac signs. These are inserted
                                within the text (on ff. <locus from="1r" to="1r">1r</locus>, <locus from="66r" to="66r">66r</locus>, <locus from="43v"
                                    to="44r">43v-44r</locus> respectively). There are also larger pictures of instruments and stages of the operation
                                for fistula in ano (f. <locus from="40r" to="40v">40r-40v</locus>). </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The other principal text in Trinity MS O.2.49 is anonymous and is titled <hi rend="italic">Salus pauperum
                                    infirmorum vel adiutorium salutis</hi> ('Health of the sick poor or aid to health'). It begins with a liturgical
                                prayer invoking God who has given medicine for men's help, and proceeds with recipes for ailments of the body from the
                                head downwards. It ends with remedies for wounds of the limbs. On f. <locus from="97r" to="97r">97r</locus> there is a
                                charm for spasm requiring names to be written on parchment and hung about the neck. The same charm is found in Arderne
                                and the <hi rend="italic">Salus pauperum</hi> has many remedies that might easily have come from his writings.
                                Following the <hi rend="italic">Salus pauperum</hi> are miscellaneous remedies including several for pestilence. On f.
                                    <locus from="99r" to="99v">99r-99v</locus>, there is a brief text by Walter Agilon, <hi rend="italic">De
                                    pulsibus</hi> ('On pulses'), copied by the same scribe as before, who ends his text with 'Explicit de pulsibus
                                quod Grene 1451'. In or about 1451 is therefore likely to be the date for the entire manuscript up to this point, and
                                Grene seems to have been the main scribe. At the end of the manuscript is an incomplete and disordered index to the
                                remedies in the text in a 17th-century hand. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">On the flyleaves preceding the Arderne writings are various recipes, notes and diagrams, which were added
                                to the manuscript by owners later in the 15th or early 16th centuries. Some are in English. On f. <locus
                                    from="[ii recto]" to="[ii recto]">[ii recto]</locus>, there are instructions for masses and almsgiving during a
                                week for a soul in Purgatory by pseudo-Bernard of Clairvaux, followed by a later charm for cramp. On fol. <locus
                                    from="[iii verso]" to="[iii verso]">[iii verso]</locus> there is a branching diagram in Latin differentiating
                                kinds of disease, beginning with those affecting the whole body and ending with those affecting distinct parts of the
                                body. </seg>
