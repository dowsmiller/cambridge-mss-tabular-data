                            <seg type="para">Cambridge, Gonville and Caius MS 379/599 is a composite medical volume comprised of several roughly
                                coeval parts copied by different scribes. The volume contains several medical treatises popular in western Europe in
                                the 12th-14th centuries including the text known as the <hi rend="italic">Compendium Salerni</hi>, works by Johannes
                                de Sancto Paulo and Matthaeus Platearius on the healing properties of simples (i.e., remedies prepared with a single
                                primary healing ingredient), and a text attributed to Petrus Hispanus on conditions affecting the eyes. There are also
                                lesser-known texts in the manuscript, such as a compilation of medicines ascribed in the rubric to 'Magister Pontius
                                de Sancto Egido', and a wide variety of other shorter, anonymous texts and remedies or charms to treat such ailments
                                as leprosy, sores, or constipation. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">The composite parts were probably all copied in England during the 13th century (although dates in the
                                late 12th century or the early 14th century are possible). The date when all of the composite parts were united is
                                unknown, but the composite parts have coexisted in this form since the late-15th or early-16th century as the volume
                                still retains its late-15th or early-16th century binding, and there is a list of the contents of the volume on the
                                    <locus from="inside_left_cover" to="inside_left_cover">front pastedown</locus> in a late-15th or early-16th
                                century hand which refers to texts which appear across the composite sections of the volume. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">Although not entirely intact as it has been <locus from="spine" to="spine">rebacked</locus> in more
                                recent times, the binding is an excellent example of late-15th or early-16th century decorative binding work. The
                                binder used small tools and a panel stamp to impress floral, foliate, and animal motifs within geometric frames in a
                                style particularly popular in Flanders and then England in the late-15th and early-16th centuries. On the <locus
                                    from="outside_right_cover" to="outside_right_cover">rear cover</locus> of the volume there is a medieval label
                                known as a 'fenestra' (Latin for 'window'); fenestras were made from a strip of parchment with a title written in ink
                                (in this case <q>Cure magistri poncii</q>), protected by a layer of animal horn shaved thin enough to be transparent
                                (the glazing in the window), and then held in place on a cover with small metal tacks hammered into the board.
                                Complete medieval fenestras are relatively rare as they often had slightly rough or raised edges that would catch on
                                things and tear away leaving only the holes for the tacks behind as evidence of their former presence on a binding. </seg>
                            <seg type="para">This manuscript, like many others included in the Curious Cures in Cambridge Libraries project was once
                                owned or used by <name key="person_v295191079" role="fmo">
                                    <persName type="display">Roger Marchall (c. 1417-1477)</persName>
                                    <persName type="standard">Rogerus Marshall (c. 1417-1477)</persName>
                                </name>, a doctor and physician to Edward IV. Marchall may have added the draft table of contents at the beginning of
                                the manuscript on the <locus from="inside_left_cover" to="inside_left_cover">front pastedown</locus>, which has now
                                largely been cropped away. Marchall is certainly responsible for the gloss to the <hi rend="italic">Curae Magistri
                                    Poncii de S. Egidio</hi> on ff. <locus from="114r" to="140r">114r-140r</locus> and he also added a title 'Gerardi'
                                in the upper margin of the opening leaf of the <hi rend="italic">Modus medendi Gerardi</hi> on f. <locus from="167r"
                                    to="167r">167r</locus>. Marchall may also have written the label in the fenestra on the <locus
                                    from="outside_right_cover" to="outside_right_cover">rear cover</locus>; he was certainly particularly interested
                                in the text as it is the only one in the volume to which he added substantial annotations, but as the binding probsbly
                                post-dates Marchall's lifetime on stylistic grounds, if the fenestra-label is indeed in Marchall's hand, then it was
                                presumably transferred from an earlier binding. Marchall's ownership or use of manuscripts is very well-attested, with
                                forty-five surviving books (including this one) bearing evidence to connect him to them in some way; six others may
                                have been his or accessed by him, and a further twelve are recorded but not traced. Marchall is known to have gathered
                                together and (re-)arranged manuscripts and the 4-part composite construction of this manuscript (not including the
                                pastedown fragments), suggests that this may be another manuscript that Marchall curated into its current form. </seg>
                            <seg type="para"> As described by Linda Voigts, the present manuscript is one of eighteen (possibly nineteen) manuscripts
                                at Gonville and Caius College that may be linked to Marchall, and which were probably donated by him to Gonville Hall
                                (as Gonville and Caius then was); King's College and Peterhouse, where the study of medicine was also supported,
                                received gifts of books from him too. Thirteen manuscripts owned or used by Marchall (and another with possible
                                Marchall connections) have been digitised, catalogued and conserved as part of the <ref

                                <p> Fully bound in blind-stamped calf over wood boards with matching decoration to left and right covers. Covers are
                                    each decorated with two concentric triple-fillet frames with Oxford corners, the outer frame set at the perimeter
                                    of the boards, and the inner frame offset by c. 30mm from the perimeter of the boards. The space inside the inner
                                    frame is further subdivided into three horizontal sections, the upper and lower sections filled with matching
                                    decorative motifs achieved with a zoomorphic panel stamp of pairs of squirrels, dragons, eagles and ?vulning
                                    ?pelicans set in round frames, and the central section filled with closely set repetitions of a small square stamp
                                    of two birds with necks entwined. </p>
                                <p>On the left cover, an early modern hand has written a description of the volume very faintly in dark ink and now
                                    mostly faded: <q>Liber [...] medicamendum cum alijs [...]</q>

                                <p>On the right cover there is a fenestra with original horn layer and metal tacks; the handwritten label bears the
                                    title of one of the works in the volume 'Cure magistri poncii' (referring to the <hi rend="italic">Curae</hi> of

                                <p>The overall design of the binding is similar to Flemish and then English bindings of the last quarter of the 15th
                                    century and the first quarter of the 16th century. As with most other finely cut decorative binding tools in use
                                    in England at this time, the zoomorphic panel stamp of four pairs of animals set in round frames was probably
                                    engraved in Flanders, and it may have been used there for a time before being imported into England. G. D. Hobson
                                    identified two other volumes that bear this stamp on their bindings: <list>

                                <p>The manuscript has had a conservative recasing - the original stamped leather covers were lifted and new leather
                                    covers were wrapped around the wood boards, before the remains of the original leather covers were replaced on top
                                    of the new leather covers. Three raised bands on spine. Head and tail bands, if present, are capped by the
                                    replacement cover. The portion of the original leather covers over the back (i.e., the spine) of the volume is
                                    gone. The imprint of the original metal fittings for the fastening, probably a hook-and-catch clasp, is visible on
                                    the right cover, the original portion of the left cover at the site of the fastening has been torn away and the
                                    board underneath has a shallow irregular depression. </p>

                                <note>Notes relating to the Hussey family including a Nicholas Hussey who is described as being the brother and heir
                                    of a Thomas Hussey who had recently been Baron [Galtrim]. The Thomas Hussey mentioned is presumably the 5th Baron
                                    Galtrim who was murdered before 1439, and the Nicholas is probably the 6th Baron Galtrim, Thomas' heir, who had
                                    died by 1493.</note>
                                <note>Note relating to a member of the Bottiler (Butler) family, describing him as an Earl of Ormond and one of the
                                    recent Chief Justicars of Ireland. Several members of the Butler family held this title and this role between 1359
                                    and 1427.</note>
                                <note>Several references to the counties of Louth and Meath, and references to places including Dunboyne, Kilkenny,

                                            between Quires 11 and 12. Folios <locus from="57r" to="83v">57r-83v</locus> have the medieval pagination
                                            pp. 1-54. The medieval pagination is absent from the leaves ff. <locus from="84r" to="86v"
                                            >84r-86v</locus>. The medieval pagination resumes on <locus from="87r" to="87r">87r</locus> beginning with
                                            the page number '79' and continues until the designation p. '103' on f. <locus from="99r" to="99r"
                                                >99r</locus>. The jump between the medieval 'page 54' and the medieval 'page 79' indicates a gap of 12
                                            leaves, i.e., medieval pages 55-78. Folios 84-86 are probably medieval pages 55-60, with the numbering
                                            trimmed away. Medieval pages 77-78 can be accounted for by the loss of the first leaf of Quire 12. The
                                            remaining 16 pages between medieval pages 61 and 76 indicate the loss at this point of a quire of 8
                                            leaves, the typical structure for a quire in this section of the manuscript. </note>
