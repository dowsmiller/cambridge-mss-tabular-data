                                Parts. The first and larger part (ff. i-vii, 1-120) is largely comprised of popular medical treatises in Latin, and
                                the second and smaller part contains a glossed copy of Guillaume de Mandagout's <hi rend="italic">De electionibus</hi>

                                contents to the beginning of the manuscript (f. <locus from="iii verso" to="iii verso">iii verso</locus>) as well as
                                rubrics and running headings for some of the treatises in the volume (see e.g., f. <locus from="1r" to="1r"
                                >1r</locus>). Marchall's ownership or use of manuscripts is very well-attested, with forty-five surviving books
                                (including this one) bearing evidence to connect him to them in some way; six others may have been his or accessed by
                                him, and a further twelve are recorded but not traced. Thirteen manuscripts owned or used by Marchall (and another
                                with possible Marchall connections) have been digitised, catalogued and conserved as part of the <ref

                            <seg type="para"> Peterhouse 95 contains several popular medieval medical treatises including the <hi rend="italic">Liber
                                    aggregationum</hi> of Serapion the Younger in the Latin translation by Simon of Genoa and Abraham of Tortosa, the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Areolae</hi> of Iohannes de Sancto Amando, and the <hi rend="italic">De simplicibus
                                    medicinis</hi> of Yuhanna ibn Masawaih (Mesue). Examination of the copy of the <hi rend="italic">De simplicibus
                                    medicinis</hi> in the manuscript reveals two unusual codicological features. First, the production of Quire 9 (ff.
                                80-91) appears to have been completed with some difficulty; some text is struck through at the end of f. <locus
                                    from="83v" to="83v">83v</locus>, the following leaf was cancelled, and a singleton was added, not, as is typical,
                                in the position of the cancelled leaf, but one leaf after (i.e., the singleton is f. <locus from="85r" to="85v"
                                    >85</locus> not f. 84), and there are further deletions and corrections on ff. 86-87. As it now stands, the text
                                in that quire (Mesue's <hi rend="italic">De simplicibus medicinis</hi>) is correct, but the scribes responsible for
                                producing this part of Peterhouse 95 appear to have performed some very precise codicological surgery in order to fix
                                their copy of the <hi rend="italic">De simplicibus medicinis</hi> while also retaining as much of their existing work
                                as possible. Secondly, a large number of leaves have been lost between the leaves now designated ff. <locus from="98v"
                                    to="98v">98v</locus> and <locus from="99r" to="99r">99r</locus>. There are 12 stubs present in the gutter between
                                ff. <locus from="98v" to="99r">98v-99r</locus>; these stubs are probably what remains of the last three leaves of
                                Quire 10 and the first nine leaves of Quire 11. The text at the end of f. <locus from="98v" to="98v">98v</locus> is
                                the last part of Mesue's <hi rend="italic">De simplicibus medicinis</hi>) in this manuscript, and it ends abruptly in
                                the middle of a sentence. The number of stubs present in the gutter suggests that some further text-leaves have been
                                lost from Peterhouse 95, as the only remaining leaf of Quire 11, f. 99, is blank, and it is unlikely that Quire 11
                                would have been placed in the manuscript if it were entirely blank. </seg>

                        <acquisition when="1472"> When and how Peterhouse MS 95 came into the possession of the College library is not entirely clear;
                            the volume probably passed into the College library collection in the 1470s (before 1477) through a donation by <name
                                key="person_v295191079" type="fmo">
                                <persName type="display">Roger Marchall (c. 1417-1477)</persName>
                                <persName type="standard">Rogerus Marshall -1477</persName>
                            </name>. Marchall was a doctor and manuscript collector, and was a royal physician to Edward IV; his annotations appear in
                            several places in Peterhouse MS 95. Marchall gave several scientific and medical manuscripts to Peterhouse in 1472; the
                            list of Marchall's donations is now preserved with the general inventory of books belonging to the College in a document
                            known as the <hi rend="italic">Registrum vetus</hi> ('The Old Register'). The record of Marchall's donations is in his own
                            hand and is on a separate leaf sewn into the <hi rend="italic">Registrum vetus</hi>. Marchall's donation document has the
                            heading <q>Billa magistri Roberti Marchall de dono suo scripta propria manu suo anno domini Millesimo 1472</q> and is
                            printed as UC48.385-396 in CMBLC 10. Marchall's donation document names or describes 12 books, none of them a good match
                            for Peterhouse MS 95; three of Marchall's donations still belong to the College, but others now belong to other
                            institutions or have been lost. Even though Peterhouse MS 95 is not one of the books included in Marchall's donation list,
                            Marchall owned a substantial number of scientific and medical manuscripts and could have chosen to give the volume to
                            Peterhouse at another time rather than as a part of the 1472 gift. The <hi rend="italic">Corpus of British Medieval
                                Library Catalogues</hi> suggests that Peterhouse MS 95 may have been left to the College as part of a bequest by
                            Master of the College, Thomas Deynman, c. 1501. Like Marchall, <name key="" role="fmo">

                            </name> was also a doctor and royal physician (in Deynman's case he seems to be associated with Kings Edward IV, Henry VII
                            and Lady Margaret Beaufort), and was a Fellow of Peterhouse before becoming its Master for a shortlived tenure c.
                            1500-1501. Deynman added ownership inscriptions in several places in the volume, but whether he gave the book having
                            obtained it personally from Marchall, or whether it was simply in the Peterhouse Library and he took it into his personal
                            possession during his association with the College is unclear. In his will, Deynman left 20 of his better books (his
                            'uolumina meliora') to Peterhouse, and so it is possible that if Deynman had taken personal possession of Peterhouse MS 95

                                    appears more like Deynman's than Marchall's; Marchall and Deynman knew each other, presumably through their
                                    Peterhouse connection and subsequent roles as royal physicians, and Deynman seems to have had access to several of
                                    Marchall's manuscripts (including this one) after Marchall's death in 1477, so it is not impossible for Deynman to
                                    have copied one of Marchall's recipes for Edward IV into one of Marchall's manuscripts. </note>

                                        <p>Quires of mostly 12 leaves. It is possible that this Part of the manuscript consists of consecutive
                                            codicological units (ff. iv-vii; 1-79; 80-99; 100-120), made by several scribes copying their texts
                                            siumultaneously rather than sequentially as there are blank columns and leaves at ff. vii verso, 79v, 99v,
                                            rather than the more typical copying-practice, where the subsequent text continues on the next line or
                                            column after the previous text concludes. In addition, the textual and decorative mise-en-page of ff.
                                            iv-120 is similar, but not absolutely identical, and appears to be the work of several contemporary
                                            scribes who worked mostly in quire-units but who occasionally reappeared for short stints throughout the
                                            volume. The first seven leaves in the volume, ff. <locus from="i recto" to="vii verso">i recto - vii
                                                verso</locus> are treated here as originating from the same source manuscript as ff. 1-120, which
                                            differs from the codicological assessments of the volume made by M. R. James and R. Thompson who treat the
                                            first quire (ff. i-vii) as a separate codicological Part. The first three leaves (ff. i-iii) are written
                                            in an entirely different style to the rest of the volume with a more informal mise-en-page and none of the
                                            decorative features present elsewhere in the volume, but are nevertheless part of the same gathering as
                                            ff. iv-vii. The text on ff. iv-vii is decorated in a similar style to the text on ff. 1-120, and the
                                            scribe who added rubrication instructions to the lower margins of ff. <locus from="v recto" to="vii recto"
                                                >v recto - vii recto</locus> appears to be the same scribe as the scribe who was responsible for the
                                            same task on ff. <locus from="83r" to="85v">83r-85v</locus>. It is possible that the first three leaves of
                                            the volume were originally blank protective endleaves for a volume whose 'main' texts started at what is
                                            now f. <locus from="iv recto" to="iv recto">iv recto</locus>, but then, as is so common with medieval
                                            manuscripts, those blank endleaves were repurposed for the storage of additional text(s). The arrangement
                                            of the quires in this Part is as follows: <list>
