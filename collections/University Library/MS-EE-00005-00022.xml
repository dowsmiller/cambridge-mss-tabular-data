                            <seg type="para">Cambridge University Library, MS Ee.5.22 is a legal manuscript written in England in the later half of the 15th century, probably
                            c. 1485. The vast majority of the texts in this manuscript are in legal French and are copies of a special type of legal text known as 'Readings'. 'Readings' were one of the primary
                            methods by which student and junior lawyers at the Inns of Court in London were instructed in English legal theory and practice before the availability of affordable
                            printed legal textbooks made the need for 'Readings' obsolete. Each year, senior members at each of the Inns of Court would be elected as 'Readers' to give
                            regular 'Readings' for half a year or a year on particular legal topics and statutes. At the 'Readings', statutes and other legal texts would be read aloud
                            by the Reader who would also lecture the audience on the significance of the text. Legal students and junior lawyers would then
                            be asked to debate matters of legal theory arising from the Reading or would take part in mock debates based on what they had just heard.
                            Readings were an important part of legal education in England before the widespread availability of printed legal textbooks, and copies of Readings made by
                            students in the audience (or subsequent recopies of those texts) are present in a number of surviving manuscripts. The original owner and copier of CUL MS Ee.5.22
                            is unknown, but Baker and Ringrose determined that it is likely that he was a member of Gray's Inn as a note on f. <locus from="184v" to="184v">184v</locus>, 
                            'mez secundum Borell', establishes a connection with Gray's Inn as at least one, if not two members of the Inn in the late-15th century had the surname Borell. Readers

                            <note><p>Note of a grant by an Elizabeth ?Shrop (Scrope) to a Richard Nevyle of the office of steward of a manor. The grant
                            mentions a place called 'Sonyngton' and the text says that that place is also known as 'Sundon' - this probably refers to the manor
                            of <placeName key="place_g7445829">Sundon</placeName> in Bedfordshire, which is spelled as 'Sonedone' and 'Sonyngdon' in various medieval sources.
                            The manor of Sundon came under the control of the Scrope family after the death of its owner Robert Tiptot in 1372.
                            When Tiptot died in 1372, he left behind three young female children, whose wardship was given to Richard le Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton (b. c. 1327, d. 30 May 1403).
                            In 1385 Richard le Scrope's son, Roger le Scrope, married Tiptot's daughter and heir Margaret and so the manor of Sundon passed into the Scrope family through
                            that marriage. Although the precise compilation date of CUL MS Ee.5.22 is unknown, the volume probably dates from the final quarter of the 15th century (c. 1485) and there
                            were two Elizabeth Scropes alive in 1485 who may have been parties to the grant. John Scrope, 5th Baron Scrope of Bolton married Elizabeth St John 
                            at an unknown date before 10 December 1471; it is not known when the marriage ended, but Elizabeth must have died before 3 July 1494 (and possibly before 1490) as another
                            marriage is recorded for John Scrope after that date. John Scrope, 5th Baron Scrope of Bolton and Elizabeth St John had a son, Henry Scrope, 6th Baron Scrope of Bolton (b. c. 1468,
                            d. c. 1506) who married Elizabeth Percy, a daughter of Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland c. 1480. The 'Richard Nevyle' mentioned in the grant
                            probably cannot be identified with any precision as there were several members of the family with that name alive in the late 15th century. The Scropes had a close relationship with the 
                            Neville family in the 15th century and had acted as guardians for each others children and had formed marriage alliances between various branches of their families and so this
                            grant doubtless refers to a transaction between these two intertwined families.

                                derive from a Middle Temple reading c. 1430.: cf. Hh.3.6, ff. 23r-28v. Substantial extracts from the whole are printed

                                    in the 17th century. The volume sustained significant rodent damage after the addition of the 17th century foliation sequence, and
                                    so replacement designations were added in the 20th century in pencil in Hindu-Arabic numerals in the lower outer corner of each recto
                                    beginning at f. 315 to redesignate the leaves that had lost their 17th century ink designations due to damage to the leaves. </p>

                                    and emended to ensure that each leaf had a distinguishing designation. The paper endleaves added at each end of the volume during the
                                    18th century rebinding were assigned the designations ff. i and ii respectively. The errors in the 17th century foliation sequence were corrected
                                    as follows:
